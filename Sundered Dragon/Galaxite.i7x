The voice yells, though its cry is slightly distorted as it echoes off the cold stone walls. 'Hey, if someone's out there, I could really use some help! The floor collapsed out from under me, I'm trapped, and can't feel my legs! Please, if someone's out there [bold type]HELP![roman type]' they wail over an almost resigned pitiable whimper. 'I-I-I, don't want to die down here...' the not too far off voice sobs from the shadows. The sheer desperation of their cry tugs at your heart strings, and a part of you wonders if you should go search for them. A more rational, cynical side of you though cautions against getting involved. The sewers are home to some rather nasty creatures, this call, no matter how realistic it sounds, may be a trap.";

Your hurried footfalls echo throughout the humid corridors as the unseen person screams and hollers after you, begging you for aid. With each passing second, their voice cracks in desperation. They promise you gold, sex, their first born child, anything you want if you'll just save them, or at the very least send help. Though as it becomes ever more obvious you're moving away from them. The voice grows increasingly angry and unhinged, spouting death threats, curses, and all manner of obscenities that would shock an old salt, but your time in the city has made you numb to such obvious ploys. You plug your ears, pressing on with all due till you're well out of range of their warblings, and in no time. You find your back at the Mall Bathroom, a little rattled, but no worse for wear.";

			say "     Unable to leave this person in the lurch, or perhaps curious about the nature of their situation, you head off in what you think is the direction of the feminine-sounding voice. As proficient a survivor as you may be though, it's easy to get yourself turned around in the oppressive gloom of the sewer tunnels as the resounds and through the interlinked web of passageways. More than once, you find yourself walking down deadends, or stopped by the odd decrepit tunnel in varying stages of collapse. Some are riddled with gnarled black roots and strange red fleshy vines likely originating from the otherworldly nanite-enhanced plants of urban forest or the swamp. Others show signs of water damage as pools of foul-smelling water cascade from deep umbral gouges in the ceiling and pools about the cracked floor as the city's failing utilities likely burst from the lack of maintenance, or result of the geological disturbance brought about by the destruction of the capitol district.";
			say "     Growing desperate, and a tad frustrated by the constant stream of setbacks, you call out to them, asking where they are, not caring who hears you at this point so long as you can locate this fellow survivor. 'I, um I'm not sure, I was following the purple line out towards the bay when the ground gave way,' the distorted voice yells from somewhere. Looking around you can't see anything that could be called a [']purple line['], just pipes, pipes, and more freaking pipes, than it hits you. The overhead utility lines are all painted different colors, likely to denote their contents. Poking around the area, you soon find one dyed a rich magenta. [if perception of player >= 20]Though something about them seems a bit... off, none of them have pipe clamps securing them to the ceiling, and a few even seem to have been woven around the older lines like a wet noodle. Guess the city was cheaping out on maintenance, you opine following the down towards what you hope is the bay[else if perception of player < 20]Oddly, unlike the rest of the pipe which are rather faded, coated in grim, or riddled with rust bubbles, the purple pipelines are all coated in pristine glittering dye as if someone just came by and painted them. Perhaps they were installed recently, you muse, following the branches down towards what you assume is the bay[end if]."; [Note: IRL a purple pipe denotes a line carrying dangerous or toxic chemicals in need of special treatment.]

Unbidden sweat and condensation drip down your face along with the nearby walls in warm copper-scented rivulets. It feels like you've walked into a monsoon jungle, or the mouth of a great decaying creature as the once still air coils and writhes about you. Which should be impossible this far underground, but you push aside such idle intrusive thoughts for the moment to concentrate on the task at hand. As you call out once more, letting the fellow survivor know you've found the line, and you're on your way. 'Oh thank Tiamat! You sound a lot closer now, just watch your step! The whole place has gotten really unstable recently,' the resounding echo of the survivor's voice hollers back in slightly relieved, though still somewhat rattled, tone. Nodding your head in acknowledgement, you voice your appreciation as you eye up some of the jagged cracks forming in the nearby walls with suspicion.";
			say "     You proceed at a measured pace keeping one eye on the ground and the other on the ceiling. As the pathway grows ever more decrepit, you have to duck and dive out of the way of a few falling bits of cement and old brick as the ground almost seems to shift and tremble in aggravation of your trespass. Each loud crash echoes throughout the sewer with a broken distorted knell almost as if you were underwater. Still, you push on and after rounding yet another twisting path in your strange circuit, you finally come upon the trapped survivor. She, at least you assume they are a she going by the presence of the pair of shapely c-cups covered up by a plain black t-shirt, is halfway buried up to their diaphragm in broken concrete. At first glance they at least appear to be mostly human (at least from the waist up) with deathly pale olive skin. Their face, despite being covered in sweat and grime, has classic almost ageless beauty like one would see on ancient Greek statues. While their ears resemble a set of blue aquatic fins with a pronounced reptile or draconic bend, and are framed by long black hair.";

			say "     Their soft golden eyes meanwhile are slitted like some sort of Lacertidae and shimmer in the dark like gutted, sputtering pilotlights with bestial desperation and forlorn hope. Strewn all around them are dozens of empty water bottles, the remains of energy bar wrappers, alongside a sturdy looking hiking backpack. As your eyes meet, they wave you over exclaiming, 'Holy shit you're real! I haven't seen anyone in days, even the mutants seem to avoid this place. I thought,' they mumble in cadence boarding on mania as they shake their head in disbelief at the sight of you, 'I thought, I was starting to go crazy when I heard your voice.' Assuring them that you are very much real, you gingerly head over to get a better look at their predicament. You realize the poor person has definitely been here quite awhile if the mess wasn't enough of an indication. The area around them is covered in rusty red speckled scratch marks. Their fingertips likewise have all been ground to raw jagged bloody edges, and their arms are covered to the elbows in gray grime.";
			say "     The cement adjacent to them though is crushed to finely-ground moist gray sand. Almost like it had undergone a partial form of liquefaction then sealed itself perfectly around them like a glove. The more you look at it, it's a wonder they weren't crushed to death, or can even breathe based on how tight the material hugs their hourglass waist. You muse, grimacing at the thought. 'That bad eh?' the post-human asks, noticing the dour look on your face. Offering them a reassuring smile, you try to tell them not to worry as you consider your options. The obvious answer would be to try and pull them out. Your combined strength may just do the trick. Alternatively, you could try convincing the Wolverines at the Mall, or perhaps some of its residents to send down a rescue party to dig them out. If you're feeling particularly malicious, you could also just steal their bag and its contents. A good backpack would be quite useful given the state of the world, after all every pound of carry capacity counts. It's not like they can stop you anyways.";

Walking behind them, you squat down and hook your arms under theirs telling them on the count of three to push with all them might while you pull. 'Ok,' the monster person replies in a dubious tone, bracing their arms beside them. Right, one, two, THREE! You grunt and lift with all the strength your [BodyName of Player] legs can muster. The ground creaks and groans as the tightly packed rubble resists your efforts, though little by little, you feel it slowly giving way as tiny fissures form across the surface of the compacted gray substrate.

Nodding nervously you tell them yes, you did. 'Ok, fuck this place and the horse it rode in on, I'm getting the hell out of here!' They cry as they try to rise on bare shaky legs. Looking like a newborn calf trying to take its first steps, they barely even manage to stand up before collapsing in a spread eagle position on the ground with a hard thud. 'Shit my legs must still be asleep and,' they pause to take hold of and massage the shapely thighs of their right leg, 'what in the fucking hell happened to my fucking leather shorts! SHIT! GOD-FUCKING-DAMN IT, those were from Mr. S leather!'";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     She, you confirm, noting the plush lips of her slightly dripping pale-bronze pussy, which she makes no effort to cover as she cries, motioning to her sweaty unnaturally-pasty-looking limbs. Unsure what to say to her, and not wanting to stick around in this crazy place any longer, you grab her bag and offer her your hand. 'Thanks, you're a real lifesaver,' she grunts, pulling herself up to her full height of five foot six. She drapes her left arm over your shoulders for support. The pair of you swiftly shuffle off, though you both eye the spot where the pit was mere moments ago, rather banefully. Already the floor seems to have been completely repaired, almost like the large rent in the ground was never even there. While it's not the oddest thing you've seen in recent days, this is definitely going on the list you muse, trudging your way back to the mall. Along the way, the survivor appears to perk up a bit as the color gradually returns to her legs. She's soon able to walk on her own power, albeit somewhat slowly.";
					say "     Not wanting to tire them out, you decide to let them set the pace and try striking up a bit of small talk to pass the time. Minutes pass and you eventually learn her name is Galaxite, or at least she claims it is, and that she was apparently looking for a supposed group of survivors that have set up shop near one of the many ghost stations hidden under the city. If what she says is true, they allegedly have access to water and power but are said to be a tad isolationist. Curious about her plans, you ask what she was hoping to accomplish by finding them. 'Well, I was sort of hoping we could work out some kind of trade deal. I mean everyone needs utilities, right? I've seen huge brawls break out in the mall over who gets to use a half dead power brick. Can you imagine how much folks would pay just to charge their phones or laptops right now? I'd probably be set till help arrives if I could pull this off!' Galaxite proclaims, rather proudly and greedily at the thought. True enough, but why is she in the sewer if she's looking for a ghost station?";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Shouldn't she be prowling the metro lines, not this god forsaken Shaft Beast and demon-infested hell hole, you reply. 'Right... well I probably shouldn't tell you this but-,'  Galaxite pauses to look around the tunnels. 'Most of the decommissioned stations are blocked off in one way or another to prevent homeless people from squatting in them, or to keep copper thieves out,' she adds, gesturing to some rubber insulated wires above you. 'The city still needs access from time to time, never know when a sump pump will break down, or a rat will chew through a power cable. From what I hear, a lot of these hidden accessways are in the sewers. If I find it, I should be able to climb right down to the ghost station. Well,' she shrugs with a bemused half smirk, 'that was the theory,' she adds as the two of you come in sight of the hole leading back up to the mall. Gazing at the lantern light spilling down from the world above, Galaxite pauses and turns to you saying in a bemused tone.";
					say "     'Hey, I know this may be a bit of an ask, but uh,' she hesitates rocking back and forth of her heels as she nervously eyes the exit, 'could you go on ahead and maybe find me a newspaper or something to cover up the goods? I don't feel comfortable walking around half naked this close to the Shag Shack. Wouldn't want the locals to get the wrong idea,' she jokes through a Cheshire smile, motioning to her lower half with a knowing flourish. Shrugging, you reply that's probably wise and hop ahead of her then root around the area for a bit. Thankfully, due to the lack of trash pickups the surrounding environment is littered with all sorts of random crap people abandoned when the pandemic started. It's not long to till you slightly less abused news rag laying about and pass it down to Galaxite. 'Thanks, you fucking rock!' she says, wrapping the moldering paper around herself like a towel and then pulls herself out. Once she's standing on Terra-firma and straightens out her shoddy covering, you follow after and go to offer her bag back, but stops you with a wave of her hand.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     'No, you keep it, it's not much, but you're welcome to help yourself to my bag and what's left of the supplies. It's the least I can do, I've got some stuff squirreled away nearby,' she says, gesturing to the outskirts of the mall with a broad wave of her hand, 'so you don't have to worry about me. It's not my first time slumming it on the streets or anything.' Nodding, you express your gratitude and wish them well. Flashing a warm almost too-toothy smile Galaxite returns the sentiment and heads off to parts unknown, muttering something under her breath about meeting someone at [bold type]the beach[roman type]. Once she's departed, you take a moment to dig through the pack. Inside, you find a pair of sugary sports drinks with a black wolf head on the logo, some clean bandages still wrapped in a thin lucid sheet of plastic, alongside a beat up claw hammer, and a few energy bars. It's not your best haul, but at least you have something to show for your work. Who said good deeds don't go unrewarded?";

				-- "Get help.":
					say "     Recalling some apocryphal news stories about people stuck in similar circumstances, you reason that it would be best to try and enlist some support. For all you know, trying to pull them out or digging around them could just make things worse. At the moment, they and the surrounding area appear to be stable, it wouldn't do you or them any good if you somehow ended up getting trapped down here with them or worse; you end up crippling them trying to save them. Sighing in defeat, you tell them you're going to have to head back to the mall and get help. 'Wait what the fuck! You're gonna leave me here!?' they cry, eyes widening in alarm. Nodding in the affirmative, you regretfully reply that you don't have means to dig them out safely, so you're going to need some help. 'Well could you try pulling me out instead?' they beg, their voice cracking with desperation. Trying to put on a brave face, you explain that you have no idea what condition their lower body is in right now.";
					say "     For all you know, their bottom half could be completely pulped. The pressure of earth and their nanite healing factor might be the only thing holding them together. If you pull them out recklessly well... 'Oh god,' they sob, looking down at their trapped form as the realization of the true weight of their situation hits them. Kneeling down, you pat them on the shoulder, telling them not to panic. Someone will come for them soon, hopefully with the tools necessary to pull them out. 'You mean it?' they croak, wiping a soot-laced tear from their eyes. Smiling warmly, you tell them that you do, and head off towards the Mall at a breakneck pace. Thankfully, the way is just as barren as when you came the way, so you make good time. Once you catch sight of the hole to the bathroom floor along with the odd lantern ever burning illuminating it. You vault up to upper level and set about looking for the nearest member of wolverine security.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Like all cops, or rent-a-cops in this case, they are never around when you need them, so you decide to cut out the middleman and head for their office in the back of the mall. You push your way through the crowds of people till you reach the back of the mall and the coffee shop that the wolverines have set up in. Most of the assembled mutants pay you no heed as they appear too engrossed in their paperwork, or fleeting moments of downtime. However, the receptionist among them, likely noting the concerned look on your face, waves you over and asks what's wrong. Bounding over to them, you hurriedly explain to them the situation in the sewers. Frustratingly, the man shakes his furry head, informing you that his company is not responsible for what happens in the sewers. His people have enough on their plate worrying about what's going on in the mall and its adjacent area. Justifiably irate, you try telling them if situations were reversed wouldn't he want someone to help him, rules be damned?";
					say "     Your argument falls flat though as the man seems unmoved citing protocols, bylaws, and every tired corporate copout under the flipping sun. Eventually, your argument draws the attention of some of the locals who gather around to watch your tirade. Sensing an opportunity, you call upon your inner demagogue and begin directing your requests more to the crowd than the man alone as you verbally paint an ever more fanciful picture of the situation. Your oration stokes the long simmering fires of distrust and ambivalence many feel towards peace officers and authority in general. Many of the onlookers stories of past grievances with the wolverines (both real and imagined) flow freer than leaded wine and venereal disease at a Roman orgy. All the while, you subtly offer the man an out if he would simply humor the idea of sending a rescue party. Sensing the collective humans and post-human metamorphs growing ire at their continued inaction, the receptionist eventually yields.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Throwing up his hands in defeat, he promises to speak with his boss and potentially assemble a volunteer search party as soon as she gets back into the office, as he claims that he doesn't have either the authority or the clout to do such things on his own. Satisfied for the moment at least, you tell him that that will have to do, then give him a description of the other survivor alongside her location; all of which the wolverine male jots down on a pad of paper that he stashes away for later. Secure in the knowledge that you've done civic duty, you make your way back to the bathroom to plan your next move.";

				-- "Steal their bag and leave.":
					say "     Thinking about it, that bag of theirs looks pretty nice. So nice in fact that you can't see why someone as foolish as this should be allowed to keep it. If they're too weak to take care of themselves, it's only natural that a stronger, smarter, more able survivor like yourself should prey upon the weak and put their meager resources to proper use. Who is to say they wouldn't do the same to you if the table were turned? You muse, eyeing their meager possessions. 'Uh hey what's up, you, uh, figured out a way to get me out of here?' the helpless survivor asks in a nervous tittering tone. Chuckling at their weakness, you stride over to them, you kneel down then calmly scoop up their pack and throw it over your shoulder. 'Hey-hey-hey, what are you doing? That's my bag!' the failed survivor bleats as you casually adjust the straps to better fit your [BodyName of Player] body in front of them before turning on your heel and start walking at a lackadaisical pace back to the Mall, without sparing the pathetic failed survivor a second glance.";
					say "     For a moment, they simply stare dumbfounded at the back of your head as the gravity of their situations fully hits them. You can hear them begin to sob meekly followed by a string of cursing and pleading shouts for you to come back that become ever more unhinged by the second. With each bend you round, the sound of their voice grows more distant, and the focus of their cries shifts from you to the ferals. As they try to get their attention, likely as one last desperate attempt to get revenge on you. Sadly for them, the area is just as desolate as when you came through the first. Whether this is due luck on your part, or something about this odd stretch of sewers is anyone's guess. Either way, it doesn't matter to you as you spot the pale sickly yellow light streaming through the large crack in the roof of the sewers that leads to the Mall's bathroom floor.";

					say "     You waste no time in mantling the rubble, and set the pack down to rifle through its contents. Unfortunately, the former survivor seems to have run through most of their supplies. Considering all the trash surrounding them when you found them, you're not too surprised. You're only left with a pair of sugary sports drinks with a black wolf head on the logo, some clean rolls of gauze bandages, a number of energy bars, and a beat up claw hammer for your trouble.

Sarea of Beach Reunion is "Beach".


to say ResolveEvent Beach_Reunion:
	say "     Wandering around the crowded-yet-calm pathways of the beach plaza, you're struck by the peaceful nature of the humans and post-humans gathered here. Sure, one or two of the infected and the occasional human get a little handsy from time to time, but all and all, the beach goers seem to be conducting themselves rather well. At least compared to what you've seen in the rest of the city, you muse, drifting through the tightly packed maze of towels and umbrellas littering the area. Nearing the northern cliff face bordering the state fair, your idle stroll is cut short as you hear a familiar feminine voice calling to you. 'Holy moly, [Name of Player], is that you?!' Searching around for the source, you spot a bare foot, heavily pregnant, bronze-skinned, bikini-clad monster woman peering over the shapely mound of her fecund tanned tummy and lush blue lycra-wrapped tits at you. As your eyes meet, you recognize that the golden orbs of the reclining figure belong to Galaxite, the woman you rescued from the sewers a while back resting front side up on a long white beach towel with a red cloth backpack set atop it like makeshift pillow by the entrance to the rocky cliffs.";
	say "     Seeing the light of recognition in your eyes, she waves you over enthusiastically. Shrugging, and a bit curious as to what she's doing here, you head on over to her. Meandering through the various beachgoers, you note she seems to be going a lot better than when you last saw her. Her skin is no longer pale and sickly looking, but has taken on a beautiful glowing bronze that highlights her sleek athletic curves and tight runner thighs. Her breasts meanwhile have gained a delightful bit of padding, most likely a result of her current pregnancy as her cute perky DDs balanced atop her taut tum look rather lovely as they strain against her tiny blue bikini top. Perhaps noticing the way you're looking at her curves, the gravid monster girl fixes you with a knowing grin as she arches her back slightly to better highlight her condition saying, 'Oh my gosh [Name of Player] it's so good to see you! I didn't know you came to the beach, here for the [italic type]view[roman type] I take it?' With an polite smile, you tell her something like, and ask her what she's doing out here.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Shouldn't she be spelunking in the sewers for her ghost station? 'Oh no-no-no,' she laughs, fanning her left hand before her as if to clear the air. 'I'm not going back down there ever again, with all the weird penis monsters, demons, and creepy crawlies, I don't see how anyone could be living down there.' So, she's out of the adventuring game, you ask. 'Nope, in fact, I'm getting ready for my next one right now.' Galaxite pulls herself into a cross-legged sitting position as she gently rests her burgeoning stomach on her lap. Really, what's she going after this time? 'Huh, not sure I should be telling you this, but-,' Galaxite teases, playfully tapping her chin. 'You did save my bacon, sssoooo here's the deal. Not long after the initial outbreak, these weird paramilitary groups showed up and started setting up shop all over the city. Of course, not all of their bases survived all that long, I think the only one left is the Zephyr branch office in the High Rise District. But after doing some digging, I found a few of them along with their equipment are still somewhat intact, but that's not why I'm here,' she says, bobbing her head towards the shore.";
	say "     'See, those bases needed tons of clean food, water, fuel, immunity boosters, not to mention raw materials to keep them running. Now as you can guess, getting that stuff into the city is really hard right now, so a lot of it never made it through. From what I hear, one of these supply convoys was coming by the sea. But, it ended up beaching itself on some rocks out past the break,' Galaxite says gesturing to the ocean, with a languid wave of her left hand. Really how did they manage that, you'd think there'd be charts or records showing where the safe shipping lanes are, you ask. 'You know, I thought the same, but,' she shrugs and reaches into a flap on the side of her pack and pulls out a paper notepad with a pen wedged into the spiral spine. Flipping through its pages, she continues, 'According to this big hunky tiger shark named Kai,' Galaxite rumbling the name in a low lusty draconic treble as she involuntarily crosses and uncrosses her legs, 'and several of the other surfers around here, the ocean floor got a little mixed after the capitol went boom, and Atlantis showed up,' she adds, setting her notepad down beside her.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Interesting, but what makes her think that anything of value survived, you reply. 'Because the local Sirens and Otters told me so silly, well,' she smirks, lips curling into a far-too-wide predatory grin, 'after I gave them a few of my old bras at least,' she says idly fidgeting with straps of her blue bikini top. 'But apparently the cargo was hermetically sealed, not sure why though. The only reason no one's looted it is because the local Pirate Sharks are fighting some Yuppie Mink in turf war over the salvage rights, and, ha-ha,' Galaxite chuckles into her hand. 'Sorry-sorry, I just realized how crazy that must sound.' Tittering, you tell her not to worry about it doesn't sound any weirder than the [one of]rumors of a invisible floating city populated by transplanar anthropomorphic blue gryphons hovering above the downtown[or]stories of a tribe of mpreg-obsessed orcs running breeding slave camps in the warehouse district[or]tales of den of gay werewolves out in the urban forest[or]scuttlebut regarding a giant bouncy castle populated by living latex monsters off the coast[or]Gossip related to a gang of kobolds running around town using their hyper balls as glorified hippity-hops[at random]. 'Heh, right point taken [Name of Player],' Galaxite giggles, in an amused little trill.";
	say "     'So ya, as I was saying, no one can get near the wreck, but... I've got a perfect plan to deal with them! Can you guess what it is? Galaxite asks, as she leans forward and rests her hand on the taut surface of her gravid middle. Eh, [one of]enlisting a diverse crew of talented ex-air men with nothing to lose to seize the boat by force[or]teaming up with a salvage ship crew led by an old sea captain whose estranged child went down with the ship and who will stop at nothing to retrieve their remains so that they can be properly laid to rest on land[or]convincing a team of veteran thieves that she blackmailed into reuniting for one last job that will leave them set for life to help slip past them[or]the power of friendship[at random]? you query. 'Nope, even better, DRAGONS!' she gushes in a haughty dominant tone as her golden eyes seems to sparkle at the mere mention of the species. 'Well, Feral Sea Dragons to be precise,' Galaxite says with a proud look on her face as she drums her fingers along the hemline of her heavily swollen bronze tummy. Wait, she was able to tame Feral Sea Dragons. How is she able to command them, they don't seem to be the most, well, talkative creatures, you ask, perplexed."; 
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Oh, I didn't tame them silly. The wild ones are great lays and give like,' she hesitates a moment as she lightly rocks her head from side-to-side, 'I wanna say the third or fourth best hugs in the city, but they are way too simple for a job like this. However, these guys on the other hand,' Galaxite pants as she leans back to stare at her ripening form. 'After they've had a little drink of mommy's milk,' Galaxite purrs rubbing her chin against the supple mass of her chest, 'become very amenable, not to mention loyal. Why I've already got a small pod of eight handsome little sea dreggys keeping an eye on me out in the surf,' she says, waving towards an oddly-shaped blue-green wave sharking about the shore. 'Once my boys here,' she points to her tummy, 'are done cooking, we're gonna go grab a few supplies and head out,' she says with a dreamy look on her face. 'Say, [Name of Player] since you seem so interested would you like to join in? I can give you a cut of whatever we find?' Galaxite asks, in an eager expectant tone.";

'Now my, mmhh, big boys here,' Galaxite pants lewdly as she strokes her fecund middle, 'can take care of most of the heavy lifting, but they're gonna need some heavy cables to dredge the larger containers. I think we should grab a few gill fruits just in case we need to go underwater.' [if hasgills < 1]Gill fruits? What are those, you ask. 'Right how to explain, uh,' Galaxite says with a thoughtful expression on her face as she wraps her fingers along the sandy shore. 'I guess you could think of them as some sort of mutagenic item like blue gryphon milk or wyvern goop. But instead of turning you into some kind of lowly hybrid or a yucky wannabe dragon, they let you breathe underwater while leaving your current form intact.' Well that does sound useful, where can you find them, you ask[else if hasgills is 1]Wait Gill fruit, you've run into those before. However, you haven't seen another tree in a while.

From what I gathered,' Galaxite pauses, picking up her pad, she reclines, crossing one of her shapely legs over the other as she idly flexes her feet and reads through her notes. 'Every time someone tries to pick one, the tree drops all its fruit. Allegedly,' she says, her eyes briefly narrowing to fine umbral pinpricks, as taps her left pointer finger against the brown cardboard-esque backing for emphasis, 'anything that hits the ground, or water instantly rots then the tree either dies, or goes dormant like that,' she adds, loudly snapping her fingers for effect. 'Lucky for us, there is one tree growing out of an old beached trawler down the coast,' Galaxite says, nodding her head towards the Wild Fringes. Right so what's the catch, you ask doubting such a rare find would be left unexploited for long. 'Well,' she says, drawing out the word in lazy drawl as her ears flutter along the tips of her raven black hair, 'it's sort of guarded by some nutty old Fruit Bats who keep attacking anyone that gets close to the [bold type]Ruined Trawler[roman type].

Don't get me wrong, given enough time. I'm sure [italic type]my[roman type], heh-heh,' she giggles as she eager traces her well-manicured nails along the supple bronze curves of her well-egged tum, 'dragons could probably haul things back on their own, but once the area is cleared it won't be long till other scavengers try to muscle in on the supply ship.

Ok, but why can't you just call them first and have them pacify the place for you. 'Uh, you could but,' Galaxite glances at the sea then reaches for her notepad and cups it to her mouth as she turns away from the water.

'I could use a little T.L.C, just look at what these sexy beasts have done to my figure,' she teases as she languidly runs her nails along the length of her rich bronze linea nigra. 'And my poor tits,' she titters, fluffing her bosom with a little flick of her chest, 'they've gotten so swollen these last few days, I can barely even see my feet.' She rumbles, flicking open the lid on her bottle of body oil and drizzles a few thin lines of clear lotion across the length of her bountiful assets. 'Much less this heavy tummy,' Galaxite simpers, as her hands glide down the bountiful curves of the well-seeded middle as she makes a show of trying and failing to wrap her hands around her lush eggy core. 'Oh, if only there were some brave, kind, noble adventurer to comfort a pure innocent maiden like myself in her time of need.'";

'You wouldn't know where I could find one of those, would you, [italic type]kin da mun[roman type]?' she asks, in a sweet tempting tone that makes your heart skip a beat as she traces a delightful swirl in the inviting curves of her midriff with one of the little dollops of shimmering oil streaming down her body in warm inviting rivets.

Its presence is oddly calming, like a hug from a treasured lover, or nuzzle from a dear pet. When you're alone, or at least out of eyesight, you often find yourself polishing or caressing its glassy surface just to watch the light dance along its pristine mirror-like surface. At times you think you see strangely familiar shapes and letters glide about its equator.
