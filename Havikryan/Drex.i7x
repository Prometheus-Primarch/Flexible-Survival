Drex by Ssamgang2 begins here.

[
""hello"" becomes "hello" in the game, make sure test is between '' only like 'hello' so
definitions on zero indentations end in a period
for example declaring a situation, or a variable
conditions that group together code underneath them if Daytimer is day: end in : and the following lines go to a deeper indentation level
falling back to the previous one when your grouped code is over
commands, like changing a variable or displaying text end in ;

one important thing to remember about indentation: you only ever change the depth of indentation when you go into a grouped code block (after a line ending in : ) or if you end one of those blocks
there is no reason for line 88 to be indented versus line 87
the compiler will immediately throw an error
line 85 and following is indented +2 because its grouped by the condition in line 84
if 84 is true (player typed  Y), everything indented beneath is run through
if it is not true, then all of the indented content is skipped

as for the code in your file - a situation (event) does make sense for the start
but not everything below
situations are things you run into by chance r by hunting while exploring
that does not fit to most of the stuff you are trying to fit in there
some of this needs to be tied into the player resting, some into the player navigating somewhere or moving into a certain room
checking if Drex is present, etc.

Just as you're about to walk out the door you hear a bark from behind and you nearly jump up from the scare, you quickly look behind you and it's the creature you rescued, you wonder how you missed him but are glad to see they're awake at least, you crouch down and pat it on the head 'hey now don't go scaring me like that buddy, nearly gave me a heart attack' you say to him.

'Hey Tails' you say, he doesn't respond, he just keeps intensely staring at you which makes you feel oddly uncomfortable. You walk over to Tails, crouch down and pat him on the head 'everything ok boy?' Tails tilts his head, guess he's fine, you get back up again in order to undress, after which you pick up Tails and put him on the bed with you 'Good night tails' you say before dozing off.

Was he just pretending yesterday? As you think that you can't help but feel that, again, he's grown bigger, going over to Tails you're sure of it now, he's definitely bigger than he was before, is he still a puppy then? The nanites can make them grow faster so maybe it's that you wonder.";

That's odd, you ask him why that is, but he says he doesn't know, just that it's always happened. you're not sure if he's hiding something or if it really is just nothing to worry about. You then ask about his eye, as you notice that one of his eyes is red now, again he tells you that when he shrank his eyes changed color. He really is mysterious, his size changes, his tails change, his eye color changes and his fur seems to be changing as well, it's as if he's transforming into something entirely different. deciding you can't get any more information out of him you decide to go to sleep, Drex tries his puppy eyes but giving him a stern look immediately makes him stop and go to sleep, as do you.";

Will you be done growing any time soon?' you ask him, hoping the answer won't be not for a long time 'I think I'm almost done growing, almost back to full strength too!' it's quite a relief to hear that, while you've grown somewhat used to him drinking your blood you'll be glad once it's over 'that's great to hear!' you tell him, oddly enough he doesn't seem that excited to hear that, almost as if he can tell what you're thinking his tails start wagging 'that's right, then I will pay you back and help you!' he says while what you almost think is him feigning happiness, but maybe it's just because of how tired you are that you're not seeing it correctly.
