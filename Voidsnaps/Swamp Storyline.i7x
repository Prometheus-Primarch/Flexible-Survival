	say "     As you tread the familiar path to the Lizard Village, you can't help but notice that the usually static presence of Kosk has disappeared. What's more, Kosk appears to have left in a hurry. A fishing pole stuck haphazardly into mud plus a faintly smoking fire are all that remains of his vigil. You quicken your pace, worried about what his absence might mean for the small community, but thankfully, you find him just inside the city limits, arms crossed as he listens to a panicked-looking lizard man. 'You don't understand. Something grabbed Laz! Something fast! Dahlia almost went to state championships in high school, and she couldn't catch up before it disappeared with him!' The panicked man gestures toward the water, waving his arms. 'We need to send out a search party! What if it tries to drown him?!'";
	say "     'Look, man.' Sighing, Kosk grabs the space between his eyes with his forefinger and thumb. 'It's the sixth disappearance this month. Didn't I tell you not to get in the water that far away from the village anymore? Since when is skinny dipping worth-' Noticing your presence, Kosk holds up a finger in your direction. 'I can't protect you guys if you wander off, so just go home and stay there for a while. I'll see what I can do, but you need to listen from now on, okay?' Still affecting his usual tough-guy demeanor, Kosk looks worried as a dripping-wet female lizard puts her arm around the distraught man and leads him away. 'I don't suppose you can pretend you didn't see that?' Kosk puts a hand behind his head and looks away with a click of his tongue. 'Don't like airing our dirty laundry to the only outsider we've let in.'";

Since you don't have a village to guard, maybe you could check things out in his place? You're pretty handy in a fight, after all! 'I suppose if you've survived so long, you can't be exaggerating. The city was a hellhole back when we fled here. If the dam hadn't busted and washed out half the buildings, who knows how many monsters would have followed us?' Sighing, Kosk walks with you back to his post, busying himself with checking his fishing line and tending to the dying fire. 'Fine. I can't seem to get the others to realize how dangerous it is, but there's this nice little swimming hole a little bit east of here, surrounded by thorn bushes. Half a dozen of our people have gone missing around there. We searched a few times but couldn't find any of them. The goblins would have just taken their stuff, maybe fucked them a couple of times, and nothing else poses a threat when you have claws like these.' Holding up a wicked set of fingers tipped with sharp reptile claws, Kosk mimics a slash in midair. 'Maybe you'll see something we can't.' After a few minutes spent asking for exact directions to the swimming hole, you thank Kosk for trusting you, shouldering your pack and looking out over the water. You'll be more wary of the still surface from now on.";

Before you know it, you've walked with him back to his post, promising to let him know if you stumble upon any more supplies as he checks his fishing line, silently letting you know you've finished talking.";

As you rub the slight swelling on your temple, you hear a low, angry voice from beyond the bars. 'Serves you right, fucker. Just a taste of what you put Matty through.' Staring down at you with pure hatred in his eyes, the frog from the swimming hole clenches his jaw.

You doubt you can get out of this place without a repeat of your capture, so you only have one choice- Talking to your jailer. Perhaps you can convince him that you had nothing to do with the kidnappings? At the very least, you might get more of the big picture.

Explaining that it seemed like the frog mistook the real kidnapper for a member of the lizard village, you tell him about the poison dart frog and his promise to return. You're a little embarrassed that you couldn't bring him yourself, but you hope your explanation of his sneak attack absolves you of blame. After all, who expects a drugging out of nowhere? 'Spots? Did you say dark spots?' Blinking in confusion, Kosk leans on the stick he's been using to poke the embers. 'I thought I saw something in the trees the other day, and that sounds familiar. Thought I was imagining things...' Sighing, Kosk shakes his head. 'I guess it makes sense, but I wish I could interrogate him.'";

Taking a small pad of paper in a baggy out of his Speedo, the frog jots something down, handing a slip to you. Scrawled in awful handwriting, the words 'Tell them Ignacio sent you,' sit above a crudely drawn map. It takes you a moment, but you eventually recognize the swamp's layout. In an area you haven't explored yet, a large building sits, surrounded by... water lines...? Does that mean it's flooded? Before you can ask, you look up to see Kosk staring at a patch of bubbles.

You DON'T belong here. If you don't want an extra asshole, you'd better get the fuck out of here.' Stammering out an apology, you slowly reach into your pack, producing the slip of paper the poison dart frog gave you. The axolotl snatches it warily and sighs while reading it. 'Yeah... That's Iggy's handwriting. Are you here for the cute lizard boy? Pity. I wanted a taste, too. Go ahead on in.' Bewildered by the axolotl's words, you follow her directions, holding your pack above your head as you wade through mid-chest level muck, hoping your feet don't find a hole in the floor. Thankfully, you make it through a series of narrow passages, ending up in a large atrium with clear water to wash away the muck. The unmistakable sounds of splashing and laughter float on the humid air, and you're surprised to find amphibians of all species and sizes playing in the pond.";

to say ResolveEvent Culprit Found:
	say "     As you find the place Ignacio pointed out, you feel something strange, like someone's bearing down on your neck. Shivering, you stop, looking around, only to hear a twig snapping nearby and a sudden yelp. Acting quickly, you attempt to mask your presence, slipping behind a conveniently placed bush and peering through its leaves. 'Well, well, well. What've we got here?' A deep, chuckling voice draws your eyes toward its owner. Coiling around something, a snake man circles his prey, grinning in a broad, unsettlingly toothy way that contrasts with a cowboy hat affixed atop his smooth head. 'Seems I picked a nice spot. The past few weeks have been fruitful.' Visibly tightening his hold, the naga reveals his prey as a face approaches his. It's Ignacio!";
	say "     'Where... Is he?' Struggling to breathe, Ignacio struggles futilely against his bonds, staring defiantly into the face of his captor. 'My... Brother.' He can't seem to get more than one word out with all the pressure on his chest, but he's as prickly as ever, pursuing his single-minded goal. 'Ah, yes. You must be referring to my latest product.' Tipping his hat and caressing Ignacio's throat almost fondly, the snake inspects his face. 'It hasn't been long since I started sampling my wares, but that boy has been irresistible. The way he begs for it.' Flicking his tongue as he speaks, the naga anaconda shudders. 'Sublime.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Take me. Let Matty go.' Ignacio pleads, gritting his teeth and kicking futilely at the coils around his bound legs. Their positioning on his body has changed, revealing his speedo-clad smooth crotch and almost nothing else. A slight crackling noise worries you, but the naga's control is enough to prevent him from breaking bones, earning nothing but a wince. 'Oh, no. That's not how this works, darlin'.' Hooking one claw beneath Ignacio's Speedo, the naga smirks, inching it down until the frog's slit lies bare. Shamelessly, he trails his fingers over it, stopping just as the tip inches inside to play with Ignacio's manhood. 'Riker will take good care of you. By the time I finish, you'll be an obedient little slut, for the highest bidder. Plenty of rich assholes willing to pay a pretty penny for some exotic ass.' Punctuating his words with a lick to swipe away the drool forming at the corners of his mouth, the naga shamelessly curls his fingers, provoking a struggle from the frog as he penetrates him somewhere you can't see. 'The best thing about you mutants- I can be as rough as I want, and you'll still be tight and ready for your new master.'";
	say "     Ignacio notices you in the bushes just as you move to stop him from being molested, shaking his head and giving you a pointed look that sends you back to your hiding spot. 'Fuck you. When I get out of this, I'll rip your dick off and shove it down your throat.' Suddenly able to draw enough breath to talk, he takes the opportunity to insult the naga, spitting in his face. 'You'll regret that. I s'pose I'll have to beat all that spunk out of you.' Tightening his grip on his Ignacio's limp form, the naga squeezes Ignacio until he slumps forward, then slithers to the cabin door, dragging him into the darkness beyond.";
	say "     <Content ends here for now!(5/19/2024) Stay tuned for more Riker, Ignacio and Matteo content revolving around saving the frogs or siding with their captor!>";
