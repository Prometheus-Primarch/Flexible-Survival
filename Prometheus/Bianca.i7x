	say "     Bianca is an anthropomorphic female wolf covered in lush, well-groomed white fur. She has a sensual body, all soft swells and curves, that aids her frequently seductive demeanor. She seems to wield moderate authority over her siblings, being Blanche's eldest daughter and well-versed at manipulation and persuasion, a tool that you are confident that she makes use of out in the city. So talented at sweet-talking, one might be forgiven for thinking her tongue was made of pure honey is she didn't so often stick it out teasingly and reveal that it is ordinary and pink. Like her mother and siblings, Bianca forgoes clothing, unashamedly leaving her C-cup breasts and black canine vulva exposed to the eye. For a moment, you ponder the effect that this might have on some of the residents of the city before shaking your head to dispel the thought. You didn't need to imagine long.";
	say "     Catching your eye as you resume looking at her, Bianca winks at you and waves, smiling brightly and adjusting her posture to better accentuate her assets. Like all her brothers and sisters, she is devoted to her mother and siblings, though she does seem especially fond of Sturm, gazing [if IncestList is not warded and IncestList is not banned]longingly [else]admiringly [end if] at him when she has nothing else to do. Her sexually-forward nature occasionally earns a concerned word or two from her mother, but for the most part Blanche is content for her daughter to find her own path in the world, a constant presence in support of her should she need it.";

I'm glad that you have time now, but don't forget about them or the others,' Bianca says, cuddling up to your side. 'Now that we're here, perhaps we can liven up this place and improve on the decorating. You've rather let the dust and dirt get away on you.' You ask how she plans on fixing that. 'I don't know, but Ernest will likely have some ideas and I should be able to get some of my other siblings to put in the work.' Unimpressed, you tell her that she should be helping too. 'I would make a joke about there being two kinds of people, but I get the impression that you want a serious answer. Labor assignment and scheduling is Mom's speciality and none of us have had any reason to complain so far. Given my talent for the aesthetic, I'm still planning out our bedroom design. If I get time, I suppose I can lend a paw dusting.' With a sigh, you accept that Blanche likely knows her children better than you. Sturm is unlikely to complain even if he has to do it all by himself.";

You don't really believe that he'd attack you do you?' your daughter chuckles, gazing at you with adoration. Smiling at her in return, you wriggle your finger around a bit, her damp nose following suit. Suddenly, you find your wrist firmly grabbed. 'If you're going to be doing that to my sister, don't behave like you are doing something sordid,' Sturm growls, somehow having appeared at your side. He looks ready to scold you further, but upon noticing Bianca's wagging tail, he turns on his heel and stalks away.

You entered the bunker to find Blanche's eldest daughter starting a conversation with the husky med-student, though you find her choice of opening question blunt. With a sigh, Sarah looks up from rolling some bandages, flinching when she notices the wolf's lack of clothes. 'Don't any of you wear clothes?' she mutters to no-one in particular before taking a breath and replying more calmly. 'I didn't call her a sex maniac, I just questioned her decision to have so many children, especially with the current state of the city. I'm assuming that you were all born recently, though if your mother is older than she looks, I suppose it is possible that one or two of you might have had time to grow up before the city went to Hell. If so, she can't have been that long out of school...' A shadow of sadness crosses your daughter's face. 'Yes, we were born into this. Sturm and I are the oldest, but Mom had been pregnant before. She miscarried.'";
	say "     Sarah immediately stands up and hugs Bianca, the smaller canine being partially absorbed into the curvy wolf's lush fur. 'I'm sorry to hear that. I've seen how devastating that is,' she says sympathetically before stepping back again. [if Charisma of Blanche > 1]'She hasn't told me the whole story, but she got pregnant in her last year of high school. When she told her parents, there was a fight and her boyfriend got hurt[else]'Don't tell anyone. We aren't meant to know, but Sturm overheard her talking to herself. She got pregnant in her last year of high school and when she told her parents there was a fight and her boyfriend got hurt[end if]. The trauma of it all caused her to miscarry. Her dad went to prison for it and she cut herself off from her parents. Ernest thinks that this may be part of the reason that she devotes so much time to showing how much she loves us,' Bianca explains wiping her eyes. The two of them stand in silence for a few moments, lost in thought. Eventually your daughter speaks. 'Anyway. Mum isn't any more a sex maniac now than she was a few years ago. She's just found someone that she trusts again' 'I'm pleased for her. I just hope that none of you end up feeling neglected,' Sarah responds. Watching them get to know each other and start a proper conversation you move away to give them some privacy.";
