		say "     Casper is an anthropomorphic male wolf with luxuriant white fur covering his toned body. Quiet and unassuming most of the time, if asked to talk about his tailoring or characters from his comics he becomes much more enthusiastic as he gets a chance to reveal his creativity and talent, gesturing freely and talking free of any shame or timidity. Somewhat effeminate in appearance, he is is as naked as his siblings bar a soft leather collar around his neck, demonstrating that he is undoubtedly male, his fuzzy sheath and balls bouncing around as he sways to some tune that he is humming.";
		say "     Realizing that he has caught your attention, Casper falls quiet and looks momentarily embarrassed before recovering and meeting your eye, smiling bashfully. Unlike his brothers and sisters, when out in the city scavenging, he often gets distracted by materials that are seemingly less important such as fabrics, comics, and posters. Fortunately for him, his scavenging-partner, Lumi, is capable of helping him with this even while fulfiling their primary duty too, enjoying the challenge and bringing the two of them closer together. While his tailoring ability isn't much used by his siblings, you know that Blanche has requested his services a few times. However, you have yet to see any of the garments that he has made for her, though given her nakedness this is of little surprise. You remain curious however.";

Sometimes I feel like Chameleon Man from the comics, always blending into the background with only my family noticing me,' Casper laments, fingering the collar around his neck. 'It's a little strange really. Not that you'd really consider it clothes, but I would have thought that the collar would make me stand out a bit among my siblings, but everyone tends to see people like Sturm, Penelope, and Bernard due to their size. Perhaps that's why I like colorful clothes and accessories. Sorry, I'm rambling, aren't I? Don't worry about me. My family, and that includes you [BlancheMommyDaddyTitle], more than look out for me. I would say that it was because I am the youngest, but we all deeply care about each other so I think it's just something we all got in the womb. Anyway, the main things that you need to know about me are that I like making costumes, I read comics in between sewing and scavenging, and if anyone hurts Lumi, they'll be my pincushion long before Sturm gets to them,' he says.";
