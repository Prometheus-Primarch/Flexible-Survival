How large will it be? Will it be friendly? What will you feed it? These questions and more bounce around your mind as you continue to absent-mindedly stroke the smooth shell.

Curious, you reach out towards the life before you, your touch stabilizing its form and allowing you to better look at it. Currently it has smooth scales and looks more suited to water than land, but on a hunch, you close your eyes and imagine it instead as a Wyvern, its wings attached to its forearms.

I am a [DragonColour] [DragonForm] and I like to explore, though for now I'm sticking to only this archive that you have made your lair. I have some difficulty opening the books, but I am careful not to damage anything. I'm care-free not careless, if you know what I mean. When I'm ready to go with you, I'll keep you safe, but until then please be careful. I do owe you for protecting my egg after all.

Perhaps one day I too shall have innumerable offspring... But I don't know much else about my home-plane and you asked about me anyway. You probably know as much about me as I do myself, but there's something especially intimate about sharing, isn't there. I am a [DragonColour] [DragonForm] and I let my passions guide me. For now I remain here, exploring my body and the sensations that I can elicit from it, but in time I may be able to join you out in the city. Just don't neglect me too long or I may find my own partners, though I'm not selfish enough to keep them for myself. Not yet though. I'm still learning the intricacies of pleasure. Speaking of which, I think that I'm due some alone time to further this noble goal. Perhaps you can find someone to study the power of lust with too?'";
