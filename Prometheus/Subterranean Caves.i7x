'Look all you want, but make sure that you can afford the price if you want to touch.'

	say "     Celeste is a moth-woman with dirty-blonde hair and purple eyes. She is wearing a thick brown jersey, modified to have a hole on the back for her wings, and tight black shorts that hug her plump thighs and backside. Her pale skin is covered by a thin, downy layer of fuzz that is soft to touch, though doing so causes her to blush deeply. Two feathery antennae protrude from just above her temple either side of her head, though she seems to only have limited control of their motion. The swell of her C-cup breasts can be seen through her jersey, the combination of the two looking distinctly soft and warm. Her two hands are steepled beneath her chin as she stares with rapt concentration at a glooping lava lamp on her desk.";
	say "     Noticing you, she waves a hand but doesn't shift her focus at all beyond that, enthralled by the lamp. A notice on the front of her desk reads, 'For service, press button'. You know that it merely turns off the light. She has a bubbly and friendly personality, perhaps a little too friendly for one who functionally runs the dungeoneering guild. Despite this, everything is well run and she is popular among the adventurers as well as the rest of the station residents, her cheerful exterior hiding the calculating mind of an administrator extraordinaire. She seems capable of keeping track of guild jobs, adventurer locations, and supply requests, in addition to the daily necessities that any business would require. All of this behind the mesmerized purple eyes that stare into the rise and fall of the ooze before her. With a sigh, you press the button to get her attention. 'Hiya. How can I help you today?'";

instead of conversing the Celeste:
	say "     '[one of]The lamp whispers things to me. Secret things. Forbidden knowledge that could topple empires and destroy reality. But I never seem to be able to remember it a moment later[or]The guild master should really take a more active role in station politics, but all he cares about is getting rich. Perhaps he should join the Merchant Guild instead, though I think Webber would have a problem with that[or]Belliandra is amazing to watch when she puts on a show in the arena, especially with how rare it is. I don't think that I've seen anyone even touch her as she flips and weaves around like a... moth[or]Webber's handsome isn't he? Those hairy legs and huge fangs... It's enough to make a girl go mushy on the inside. But I'm stuck here and he's out there, so it wouldn't work. Plus I'm practically married to the guild. I guess that means that the guild members are my children[at random].'";

instead of fucking Celeste:
	say "     'Awwww, I would love to. But I've got all this paperwork to do first and I don't see myself finishing it any time soon. I'd ask you to help, but the guild master put in place rules after a past incident. No more sex on the job, and no amorous advances on luminous objects,' she apologizes. You blink. There is more to that but you don't dare ask. Yet.";

By comparison, her antennae are much more animated, constantly flicking and quivering, especially when she becomes excited. Being bipedal, she has two sets of arms, though the lower pair remain folded at her side most of the time, only becoming active when she requires the extra hands or strength that they provide. Though it is hidden at the moment, you know that she has a sting hidden in her abdomen. You don't want to know what the nanites might have done to its potency.

Nonetheless, she seems to have taken up the role of Station 69's primary protector, her many children acting as guards against any threat towards the people living there. Rarely seen without the co-leaders of the royal guard, Emmett and Milly, she occasionally leaves her nest to visit the market or the arena, taking the time to converse with people who approach her.

	say "     Belliandra is an anthropomorphic cat with brown and black-blotched fur and emerald-green eyes. About six-foot tall, her slender frame hides a surprising strength that is only amplified by the speed that she seems to move at when the situation calls for it. While her hind-paws look like normal enlarged paws, her front paws instead resemble hands, though she still has the soft pads in the palms and at each finger tip, along with sinister-looking retractable claws. Behind her, her tail flicks around, perfectly in sync to help her maintain her balance or move out of the way of an opponent's attack. Wearing form-fitting leather armor that comfortably holds her B-cup breasts tightly to her chest, her movement remains unhindered while still providing her some protection. At least you assume that it would protect her, you've yet to see her in proper combat. At her hip, you spot two short-swords in ornate sheaths, the design of which is too intricate for you to make out at a glance. For now, they remain ornamental.";
	say "     Amused by your observation, she winks at you and flicks her tail. She seems to have a cheerful personality and you have yet to see her not smiling, smirking, or teasing. Confident in her capability, she cultivates an aura of competence and safety. Much of her time seems to be spent training combatants in the arena, patiently tutoring them on the finer points of fighting with sword, spear, as well as unarmed combat, though the weapons are decidedly blunted in order to reduce lasting harm. You are not sure how much of the Station's security is due to her presence compared to the efforts of the Ant Colony and Dungeoneering Guild, but you have little doubt that the people living here appreciate the safety that she provides.";

With that answered, you enquire as to whether that will be a problem. 'Not at all. It's just been quite some time since I trained someone with such a large family who wasn't immortal.' Feeling left out of the conversation, Blanche walks over, hearing the last sentence. 'I'm not immortal as far as I know, but I certainly want to protect my pups. Should I assume that you are some sort of cat-demon?' the wolfess asks, pressing herself against your back when Belliandra begins to laugh. 'Demon? No. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with being a demon. Some of my siblings are, but others are celestials, dragons, or kitsune among other beasties, but I'm just a catperson.

I do this purely for my own enjoyment and because I like to help people,' Belliandra reassures Blanche, the white wolfess looking much more relaxed now. 'Then let us get started. I gather that this is your first time receiving formal training in combat, so we'll refrain from using weapons for now. Is this acceptable?' the feline asks, gently guiding the wolf a few feet away from you so that they have space to move unimpeded. When Blanche nods, the arena master continues, 'Excellent.

The descent is tedious, [if Resolution of Strike From the Deep is 1]both long and treacherous[else]more so than last time[end if], and it feels like hours have passed by the time you reach [if Resolution of Strike From the Deep is 1]a vast cavern, covered in what appears to be luminous fungus, tinging the air with blues and greens in an almost fantastical manner[else]the cavern at the bottom, the same blue and green luminous fungus lighting the area[end if]. With no immediate threat, you take the time to enjoy the moment, the cool, damp air and soft lighting having a calming effect on you. 'It's quite the sight isn't it?' a gentle voice comments from behind you, making you jump. Hastily turning around, you come face to face with two spider-people, one of whom looks on the plump side, while their companion[if Resolution of Strike From the Deep is 3], whom you are sure that you've seen before, [end if] possesses a wiry strength despite being slender.";
	say "     'Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. I don't believe that I know you. I'm Webber,' the round spider introduces himself, offering you a claw-like hand. You cautiously shake it while you inspect the two of them. Webber is wearing a white shirt, burgundy waistcoat, and black trousers that look like they were tailored to him, as well as a strange sling that seems to support his abdomen behind him. By comparison, his companion's appearance is largely obscured by a dark coat, though you notice two swords and several daggers on a belt at their hip. You also can't help but notice that their eight eyes are cloudy. 'My name is Varenya, and yes, I'm blind,' she says, seemingly feeling your gaze on her. 'She's my guard and more than capable I might add. Uses her hair to detect air flow or something,' Webber explains, his admiration clear. 'Usually I wear fewer clothes to better sense my surroundings, but I'm trying to train to be better,' the female spider adds before her companion continues. 'We were just on our way back from Beard Hearth. I'm a merchant from the Station 69, so you can understand why I would need an armed escort.'";

	if Resolution of Strike From the Deep is 1: [Did not pursue mole. Never seen Webber before]
		say "     Seeing your look of confusion, Webber's eyebrows raise in surprise. 'You've never heard of Station 69? Are you another adventurer? Just where are you from?' he asks incredulously. You guardedly reply that you found a tunnel down here from the city, leaving out the fact that it is connected to the bunker. ";
	else:
		say "     Seeing your look of confusion, Webber's eyebrows raise in surprise. 'You've never heard of Station 69? Are you another adventurer? Just where are you from?' he asks incredulously. Before you can answer, Varenya instead replies, 'From above. I saw them a while ago,' causing his eyebrows to shoot upwards in surprise again. ";
	say "'Fascinating. We haven't seen anyone from there since this all began. But I think that we should avoid any further discussion until we are somewhere... less prone to eavesdroppers. Would you like to come back with us to the Station? I can give you a tour,' Webber interjects, glancing around hurriedly. His behavior suggests that this isn't part of a kidnapping plan, so you tentatively accept his offer, much to his relief. Gesturing for you to follow, he heads towards one of the many tunnels, Varenya a few steps behind him. You find yourself in a tunnel similar to the one that you came down here in, though there are metal struts bracing the roof and walls every few meters as it slopes upwards.";
	say "     After a few hushed words between them, Webber turns his head and gives you a friendly smile while Varenya turns around and hurries back to the entrance of the passage. 'She'll catch up later, but this way we can be sure that we aren't being followed and I can briefly discuss the surface with you before we get into town,' the spider merchant reassures you as you begin to ascend. 'The overworld is a matter of conflict between those of us under the ground. Some, like me, lived there before we were transformed, but haven't been able to find our way back since. There are four main [']factions['], if you will, down here. I do business with all of them, some to a lesser degree than others. Station 69, where I am from, the Dwarves of Beard Hearth, the Illuminated, and the Children of the Dark.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     I'm Merchant General, or whatever other silly title they've changed it to, of Station 69, so I'm not entirely unbiased. We try to remain neutral in the disputes between factions, but we also take in those that the others reject. This occasionally causes friction with their previous allies. Then there's the Dwarves of Beard Hearth, though they call their settlement something else that I can't pronounce. They do a lot of mining and other things that you would associate with the dwarves of fantasy. They tend to react with hostility to anyone who interferes with this, no matter which faction they are. The Illuminated are the almost fanatical followers of some scientist. He's helped a lot of people with his inventions, but his ethical standards leave much to be desired. Finally, the Children of the Dark are mostly partially-feral creatures and monstrosities led by some druid. They aren't particularly friendly, so I would stay away from them if I were you.'";
	say "     You grunt noncommittally. Though the memory of the mole resurfaces, you'll make your own decision on the matter. After all, it's not as if everything down here will be neatly sorted into one faction or another. 'Anyway, to return to you being from the surface, perhaps don't tell anyone else. Some people view the world above as something to be conquered and I can't promise you that they won't hurt you. Until I can be sure that interactions will be peaceful with the city, I intend to keep everyone in the dark about it. Metaphorically of course. We have electricity,' Webber explains, nervously laughing at his own joke. Soon the tunnel widens out and you arrive at a gateway guarded by several ants, all of them wearing armor and wielding weapons that look more suited to the Medieval era. A sign to your left proclaims, 'Welcome to Station 69'. Surveying the sight before you for a minute, it gives Varenya time to catch up with you again. 'Shall we go in? I still need to give you a quick tour,' Webber asks with obvious excitement.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Thought he guards stare at you curiously, with the spiders beside you, they don't challenge your entry into the settlement. You enter what might have been quite a grand market square, but none of the stalls seem to be open at the moment. Nonetheless, there is a decent amount of activity between citizens standing around talking and people walking in and out of a building to your left. 'Welcome to the Marketplace, the central point of Station 69,' Webber announces, earning a chuckle from Varenya. 'Unfortunately, we are in the middle of a dispute over fees,' he concedes, directing a reproachful glare at his companion. 'Some of the more public-spirited residents want to increase them so that more money can be put into benefiting the community. Unfortunately, the majority of merchants are resistant to this and forbid all internal trade until it is settled. Celeste and, to a greater degree, Queen Myra will force them to relent in time, but until then the market stalls remain closed. You'll get to meet them soon.'";
	say "     You ask that if he is Head Merchant, why doesn't he make them comply immediately, stifling a laugh as he winces at the absurd title. 'The Merchant Guild doesn't work that way. My vote within the guild doesn't count for any more than the other senior members. Those of us that believe that funding the protection of the station will benefit us all in the long run are outvoted by those that value profit above security. If things get too dangerous here, they'll likely just relocate to Beard Hearth. I then have to represent the Merchant Guild's stance rather than my own when discussing with the other influential institutions. Politics here is different to how the world used to be. We aren't a democracy. Major decisions are decided by representatives from the Merchant Guild, Dungeoneering Guild, Ant Colony, and Arena. I represent the merchants obviously. Technically the Dungeoneering Guildmaster should be their representative, but as he's a selfish bastard and doesn't care about the station, the receptionist, Celeste, and de facto leader of their guild does so instead. When she can be separated from her lava lamp.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'The Ant Nest is obviously led by a queen, in this case Myra. Her children guard us all and if she wanted to she could likely govern without us. Fortunately, she seems to prefer things the way they are, mingling with the people from time to time and occasionally inviting someone that has impressed her to sire her next generation of children. I have not been propositioned, in case you were wondering. Finally Belliandra is the Arena Master. She claims that she is from another world and I believe her. She is unnatural in the way that she moves and I don't think that I've seen anyone land a blow on her in all her time here. Perhaps you might manage to be the first, but I doubt it. She always seems to be just that little bit faster than whoever she comes up against. Anyway, now that I've talked your ear off, shall we visit Queen Myra first, then we can visit the arena via the Dungeoneering Guild?' Webber asks, not really giving you a choice as he immediately strides towards a cave entrance to your right, Varenya close behind him.";
	say "     Following them, you enter a large room full of people, the majority of whom are ants busily going this way or that, though a few seem to be standing around conversing among themselves or with people that you assume are also visitors. With the female spider deftly clearing you a path, Webber doesn't give you much time to admire the domed ceiling and the elegant criss-cross of wood that braces the dirt walls and roof, gently guiding you through the crowd until you reach the opposite side of the room where two armored ants stand guard by a sturdy door. After a few hushed words, one of them vanishes through the door for a few moments before returning again and bidding you enter. 'Be on your best behavior. You're about to meet Queen Myra,' Varenya murmurs as the three of you are escorted into the royal chambers. As soon as the door closes behind you, the noise and chatter of the hall is stifled, allowing you to easily hear the queen speak.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Welcome,' Myra greets you, the tall reddish-black ant flanked by two large guards. 'I would offer you a seat, but as the silk merchant informs me that you are only here briefly as part of your tour of the station and I have an appointment with some of the less agreeable members of the Merchant Guild, I shall refrain from such hospitality until we have more time available. I am Queen Myra. Please address me as [']My Queen['] when in public, but here you may call me just Myra. These are my guards, Emmett and Milly.' The first guard, Emmett, merely nods at you, but his partner is warmer in their introduction. 'A pleasure to meet you. I'm Milly, joint leader of the Royal Guards. As long as Her Majesty is happy, we're happy too, even if Emmett hides it. He takes his duty very seriously,' she says chuckling. Emmett's sighs and twitches his antennae. 'I don't know them,' he mumbles.";
	say "     Clapping her hands to quieten them down again, Myra continues introducing herself. 'My nest provides the majority of protection for the station, along with manpower for construction and other physically intensive work. Few would disagree that Station 69 wouldn't exist without us. Like Webber, I remember the world before we came underground. I was an entomologist studying ants, specifically [italic type]Paraponera clavata[roman type], the bullet ant. This is the form that I have ended up as. I was fortunate enough to survive my laboratory being devoured by a sinkhole and eventually, after wandering the tunnels, I ended up here just as the settlement was being formed. [italic type]Paraponera clavata[roman type] aren't known for making nests underground, but I'm not a complete slave to my species so I made the best of my circumstances and after a few... romantic encounters, I made my nest here.' Myra pauses to take a breath before bashfully averting her eyes. 'Was that sufficient enough an introduction for your tour? I know that it was brief, but the merchants could arrive soon and it would be best if a stranger wasn't seen leaving here immediately beforehand,' she apologizes.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'It's perfectly fine. We need to continue the tour anyway,' Webber says placatingly. 'Nonetheless, feel free to visit me again when you can. I will hopefully be able to give you the hospitality that you deserve,' Myra replies, turning to you. Dismissed, you follow the two spiders out of the queen's chambers and back through the court, passing three well-dressed figures, a bull, a lion, and a dwarf, as you reach the exit of the nest. They tersely nod at Webber, ignoring both you and Varenya before striding the opposite direction to you. 'It looks like we left just in time,' your guide mutters as you exit the cave. You would assume that they were Myra's next appointment. Your next destination seems to be the grand-looking building on the opposite side of the marketplace, a crossed-pickaxe-and-sword sign, with the words [']Dungeoneering Guild['] beneath it, hanging outside. 'Let's see if we can distract Celeste from her lamp for a few minutes,' Webber announces jovially as you make your way over and slip through the door as a polite adventurer holds it open for you before hurrying after his friends.";
	say "     The first thing that you notice when you enter is the number of people. You wouldn't have thought that you could fit this many adventurers in here from the outside, nor that they would be able to find so many dark corners in which to congregate and talk, filling the air with a babble of conversation that you can't discern the words from. 'Dungeoneering is very popular, you might notice,' Varenya comments dryly before directing you after Webber as he heads for the front desk which fortunately seems to be adventurer-free at the moment. The moth-girl staffing it seems mesmerized by a lava lamp that is languidly glooping in front of her. Remembering the spider's words, you assume that this must be Celeste, the real power within the guild. After waving his hand in front of her in a vain attempt to catch her attention, Webber sighs and presses a button on the front of the desk. The lamp immediately falls dark and the moth's attention slowly slides over to focus on the exasperated arachnid.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Hiya Webber. Planning a shift in careers?' she asks. As her gaze shifts over to you, you notice her sit up a little straighter upon seeing Varenya. 'And who's this? Hello new person. Welcome to the Station 69 Dungeoneering Guild,' Celeste greets you with a sincere smile. 'I... don't think I actually asked their name,' Webber responds, bashfully looking at his feet. 'Neither did I,' Varenya adds when the moth turns her attention to her. Pouting cutely, Celeste jumps off her chair and marches around her desk over to the three of you. While not as tall as the two spiders, she has a certain presence about her that makes her height inconsequential. 'Neither the Merchant General or one of my best adventurers had the decency to ask [ObjectPro of Player] [PosAdj of Player] name? But I bet you both told [ObjectPro of Player] your names,' she scolds them before giving you a makeshift curtsey, her thick brown jersey almost acting as a dress. 'A pleasure to meet you. My name is Celeste and I'm the receptionist/coordinator/acting guildmaster of the Dungeoneering Guild. Might I know your name?'";
	say "     Chuckling a bit, you introduce yourself. 'See! Was that so hard?' the moth-girl asks the spiders with exasperation. 'I suppose that you are just passing through on your tour of the settlement? Want me to give you a quick rundown of what we do?' Celeste offers you, beaming when you nod. 'While the Merchant Guild is the economic backbone of Station 69 and the ants are local security and labor, the Dungeoneering Guild allows us to protect ourselves from threats before they arrive while also giving the many adventurers that seem to appear from nowhere an outlet for their talents. In exchange for a share of any treasure found or a cut of the job fee, we coordinate the adventurers and ensure that if anything happens to them, a team will be sent to rescue them. We also have facilities such as bath-house, archive, and healing facilities for our members. Despite this, most of them seem to prefer lurking in corners here in the main hall,' she directs a look of annoyance at the many people doing just that.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'The actual guildmaster wanted to run us more like a mercenary company, but me and Belliandra put a stop to that. We aren't at war and adventuring is meant to be fun rather than treated wholly like a business. Now he barely leaves his private chambers and I'm the next most senior member so I'm acting guildmaster, but don't get any grand ideas. I couldn't fight to save my life. I'm a clerk, not a warrior.' 'Awww, don't be so hard on yourself,' Varenya almost croons, ruffling Celeste's dirty-blonde hair, making her smile goofily. 'That about describe us?' the moth-girl directs at Webber. 'Wonderfully so. I couldn't have put it better myself. Unfortunately, time is getting away from us and I still need to show our guest the arena,' he replies. 'That's okay. The lamp is calling to me and I would be a fool to resist it,' Celeste says, already slinking back around her desk. Hopping back onto her chair, she waves you goodbye. 'Be sure to come back if you want to sign up with us. I'd be more than happy to go through the forms with you,' she purrs enticingly.";
	say "     Varenya guides you towards a door to the north. 'Time for you to meet my mentor and the best duellist you will likely ever meet,' she says eagerly, causing Webber to roll his eyes but smile good-naturedly. 'Don't praise her too much or she'll already be purring before we get there,' he taunts. After traveling along a corridor for a while, you find yourself back outside again in the middle of an arena, a tall brown and black-furred feline woman clad in leather armor pressed up against a self-conscious badger as she adjusts his posture in front of a training dummy. 'Take a few minutes rest and we'll resume once I finish talking to my guests. Correct stance takes time, so don't be discouraged,' she says warmly to him before turning around to face you. 'Ah, Varenya, how was your trip? And Webber, I hope that your business with Odric was successful,' she addresses them before bowing to you gracefully.";

Like Varenya, I am not of your world, though I suppose with the number of adventurers that seem to turn up, that isn't exactly much of a revelation,' she laughs. 'I am a capable combat instructor, both for entertainment and more... practical applications. There always seem to be people trying to hurt each other and people that want to be able to defend themselves from being hurt, so if you or anyone that you know wants some proper physical training, no matter their appearance and capability I can do it. Magic isn't my forte, sorry. Payment is negotiable, whether it is precious metals, food, or as some seem to prefer, intimacy,' Belliandra explains, her eyes flicking over you.";
	say "     'The arena used to put on a show every few days, but we're currently undergoing some renovations to increase safety. The fighters can get a bit over-enthusiastic and ruptured organs are best avoided. Once we're finished, the men, women, and anything beyond or in between will be nearly as safe as they can be and I won't need to be as ready to intervene personally. Until then, I'm content to lend my experience to training anyone that is willing to learn. Now, as I'm sure you only came to see me as part of Webber's tour, I should get back to helping Roderick with his foot placement. It's a lot easier to knock someone over if they haven't positioned their feet correctly. Until we meet again[if Player is not defaultnamed] [name of Player][end if]. I hope you'll visit me when you have the time, perhaps have a few lessons.' Bowing to you again, she turns back to the dummies and indicates for Roderick to ready himself again.";

	say "     'Well, that's everywhere that I needed to show you,' Webber declares. 'The residential area is private and not somewhere that people who don't live here need to go unless invited, so I don't need to show you around there. The Merchant Guild is obnoxiously unwelcoming, so I won't put you through that nor would I advise you enter without me. So, unless you have any more questions, we can return to the marketplace and you can decide what you wish to do from there.' 'I'll say goodbye here then. I have some things to do in the tunnels and I want a quick word with Belliandra before I go,' Varenya responds, hugging Webber and nodding to you. 'Perhaps when I know you better, you can have a hug too. All six arms worth.' Your return to the center of the town is uneventful and after reminding you that everyone (even Emmett) would be more than happy for you to visit them again and to stay out of trouble, Webber excuses himself to return to his guild with news on his business with Beard Hearth, leaving you to choose what to do next.";
