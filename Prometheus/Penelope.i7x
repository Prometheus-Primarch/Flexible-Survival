The scent of Penelope is "     Penelope smells of fur-care products, which isn't surprising given her luxuriant fur. You also think you can catch a hint of Wendis's scent on her too."

	say "     Penelope is an anthropomorphic female wolf with fluffy, white fur making her appear even broader than her already stocky frame. The tallest, and probably physically the strongest of Blanche's daughters, were you to grasp one of her arms, you would easily feel the muscle beneath the soft fluff. While for the most part she looks stoic and intimidating, this effect is soon dispelled when among her family, her tail wagging incessantly as her expression becomes bright and engaged. Two C-cup breasts covered in downy fur peek from the fluff of her chest, uncovered by clothing. Similarly, you occasionally catch a view of the soft lips of her canine spade beneath her tail when she bends down to boop Wendis's nose.";
	say "     Seeing you look at her, Penelope straightens up again and waves in greeting before folding her arms under her breasts and standing still to bask in your attention. Whether or not it is intentional that this accentuates her bust, you do not know but decide not to bring it up. Seldom seen without her younger sister, Wendis, somewhere nearby, often hanging from her shoulders giggling, Penelope is amenable to fulfiling the requests of her siblings, though for the most part she acts as protection and as a calming influence on some of their more intense personalities. Though she doesn't actively wield much authority over any of her siblings, her opinion on matters is usually respected though not always heeded.";

No one giving you any trouble that requires a family of wolves to fix?' she asks with a smile. You reassure her that there is not. 'That's good. Mommy would lead the charge if there were. Even if it were one of those drakens, she'd be there to protect you. You're very special to her. And to me. To all of us really, but especially to her. Sorry if I'm talking in circles, Wendis usually gets most of the attention in conversation. Perhaps if we spend more time together, I'll be able to talk more easily?' Penelope suggests hopefully. With a smile, you tell her that that sounds like a good idea, making her beam and almost crush you in a hug. 'Love you lots, [BlancheMomDadTitle].'";
