The scent of Wendis is "     Wendis smells of sweets, though where she found them she has yet to share. You also think you can catch a hint of Penelope's scent on her too."

to say WendisDesc:

		say "DEBUG -> HP: [HP of Wendis] <- DEBUG[line break]";
	if HP of Wendis is 1:
		say "     Wendis is an anthropomorphic female wolf with soft and fluffy white fur covering her petite frame. Much smaller than her siblings, maybe only four foot tall at most, she frequently takes advantage of her appearance to tug on the heartstrings of the more friendly occupants of the city while out scavenging. Care-free and friendly, possibly to the point of naivety, she is usually cheerful, her tail wagging wildly behind her as she attempts to brighten her siblings['] day. Despite her height, she is no child, two B-cup breasts hidden beneath the lush fur of her chest and a delicate curve to her waist. Like the majority of her family, she eskews wearing clothes, meaning that occasionally you catch sight of her puffy vulva beneath her restless tail.";
		say "     Noticing that she has caught your attention, Wendis rushes over to you and hugs you with all her might before leaping back and hopping from one hind-paw to the other with excitement, inadvertently jiggling her modest chest about as she moves. Often seen hanging around the neck of her older sister, Penelope, who seems to be her favorite person in the world, she spends a significant amount of her time boosting the morale of siblings who have had limited success in their scavenging runs or practicing her aim at throwing stones due to her physiological limitations. It would be hard to find anyone who dislikes her.";

'How are you today? Have you been doing anything interesting? Which of us is your favorite? Do you have any treats for me?' Wendis's barrage of questions is intimidating in a very different way to Sturm's scowls. It makes you wonder whether she manages to take advantage of her siblings and Blanche with her sweet demeanor. 'You're looking at me funny. Did I do something wrong?' she says with worry, interrupting your thoughts. As she clings to your side, you half dismiss your previous idea. Her family may spoil her, but her joyful personality suggests that there is no malice or megalomania behind it.";

You have to admit that it is quite the enthusiastic response, though no less adorable. 'That was delightful, but you do realize that I'm not a child despite my short stature and overflowing optimism,' she says, suddenly more serious. 'Perhaps you can join some of us when we play some of our erotic games.' With that made clear, she relaxes and snuggles up to you, enjoying the contact.";

We also occasionally play a game where we pose hypothetical lewd situations to each other and have to answer what we would do in them[if IncestList is not warded and IncestList is not banned]. Even Mommy joins in and then it's really fun[end if]. You could play it with us too if you want.' While Wendis has said no, it sounds like she is very open to the idea in future.";
