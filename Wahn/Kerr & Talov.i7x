Version 1 of Kerr & Talov by Wahn begins here.

[
Kerr & Talov

- met in College; married
- somewhat immature relationship so far, together 3 years
- future conflict/growth potential as the BJ by Benjamin & Kerr comes out
- two different kind of hookups for their relationship: friend who fucks (player, Richard), random fuckbuddies (from the party, who're pounded and then pushed out the door; mostly doggystyle/bent over)


Talov:
- the "smarter" one of the two, good student in college
- calls Kerr "my hubby"; addressing him as "babe"
- sexual views:
	male: loves big guys, playfully dominating them; enjoys a hairy chest
	female: experimented with women before, would be fine with trans-males - doesn't like licking pussy or breasts (prefers a firm pec), but is fine with fingering/fucking pussy; likes moaning, but not squeals that hurt the ears
	quirks: likes creampies (especially with his husband), but also painting Player in cum
- has a little bit more educated word-choices ("fellow", etc.)
- sassy type of speaking
- worked as an archivist in the museum, got transformed to be a satyr but then _didn't_ join in for the frolicking and fucking but went home instead to his husband
- Colleagues: Lionel (colleague in the museum), Hughes (security guard in the museum)
- had some jealousy over Kerr hanging out with Benjamin so much (include him ribbing Kerr about going on that rowing trip - reply "yeah, but I chose you" (then hug and nuzzle)" )

Kerr:
- Real Name: Cian Kerrigan
- calls Talov "my man"; adressing him as "hobi" (arabic)
- sexual views:
	male: likes being dicked (since the transformation, its become a true preference); enjoys vocalization to show his partner his feelings; enjoys smooth-chested males
	female: 100% gay, hasn't done anything with a woman before - not interested
	quirks: likes his balls being sucked on after coming
- was pushed by family expectations to go to college for a business degree; got really bored by it and partied a lot instead; eventually quit and started in a construction job (likes the physical work)
- knew Benjamin and was good friends while in college; even went on the Colorado River trip with him ("we wanted to come here to this frat, because they're good people - knew the previous president and all that")
- Benjamin did actually give him a BJ during the trip; one night during the evening (campfire, a bunch of drinking - Kerr pretty wasted, Benji pulled his pants down somewhere a bit outside of the light and sucked him off); didn't tell Talov about it in detail since he didn't want him to freak out over it, but did always start taking Talov along if hanging out with Benjamin (doing something to show B that this was his man) - meanwhile Talov was all ('is he building up asking me for a threesome with the dude? why does he want to hang out with B and me so much')
- knows stuff about trees (types, wood, whatnot)
- more simple, down to earth talk
- anxious/distracting mannerism: adjusts his dreadlocks

Story Hook:
- player finds old pictures from that trip back in the day with Benjamin

If Player refuses the party and Kerr + Talov do not get in: [resolution -1, -2, -3]
- they start drinking in the street, then Maron confiscates the barrel

	say "     As you're wandering around the campus, you spot an interesting sight somewhere ahead of you. There is a pair of satyrs on one of the more populated main walkways across campus, rolling along a heavy oak cask in the direction of the dorms and frat-houses. They're a bit of a mixed couple, one with a relatively slender swimmer's build, light skin and red hair, the other more broad, with a muscle-packed torso and dark brown hair. The two of them seem in rather good spirits, if somewhat sweaty from maneuvering their load, though they always seem to have a friendly smile and greeting ready for students who pass them on their way to places on campus. Walking in the same direction as they do, you slowly start to get closer to the pair as they're moving a little slower than you. This gives you the chance to observe a haughty-looking Spartan stroll up to them, flanked by two other young men, one of them similar in build to the leader, the other fairly enormous for a human. Some words are exchanged as the Spartan seems to interrogate the satyrs for a moment, before waving them past with a sour expression on his face, then continues the patrol with his two companions.";
	say "     With the interaction between the satyrs and Spartans having held them up, you catch up with the duo, just in time to hear the red-headed satyr say, '...what a pleasant fellow, eh? I understand that keeping order is necessary, but that was downright rude. Good thing he couldn't say anything about alumni visiting their old stomping grounds.' The other, more muscular satyr opens his mouth to reply, but then he spots you and gives you quizzical look. It seems like he recognizes that you're not on your way somewhere, like the students streaming past with relatively quick strides. Curiosity about what you might be doing drives him to call out, 'Hey there, nice to meet ya! How's it going? I'm Kerr, and this is my better half Talov. We're just on our way to bring some wine to a frat, so we can make an awesome party even better!' Drawn into a conversation with the cheerfully smiling man, you introduce yourself in turn, ";

You did see that bunch of sandal-booted thugs who stopped us, and are about 50 feet that way? There's a bunch more of them, and they really seem like the type that curb-stomps people who act up.'

When he comes back a moment later, he says, 'We've got a small issue... they've got someone standing guard.' Seeing your questioning expression at this, he makes a circling movement with one hand, seemingly indicating the whole city, 'Guess with everything going on, they're worried about party-crashers. Not that that's what we wanna do - all our wine will do is bring some extra fun into the mix! But yeah, they might not see it the same way at first... and we kinda expected the guys to be tipsy and distracted enough not to care too much if we join them.

Curiosity drives you to investigate yourself and you take a stroll past the frat house on your own.

The larger of the two, Kerr, is a large man with of what seems to be middle-eastern descent, showing strong muscles and a cheerful demeanor. Letting your gaze wander over his form, you see a strong set of hooves, goat-legs with dark brown hair, a thick, uncut cock, a quite muscular hairy chest, as well as a full beard on his face and thumb-thick dreadlocks on top of his head. Around his neck rests a puka shell necklace bearing some sort of rough and natural green crystal as its centerpiece. Finally, a pair of curling ram's horns at the sides of his head complete the image of a friendly and jovial satyr.";
	say "     His husband is Talov, who's more slender than Kerr, with fairly light skin and red hair on his goat-legs, an uncut cock somewhat thinner than Kerr's, a completely smooth and hairless chest, as well as a red goatee and a mid-length shock of hair on his head. His ears are furry too, having a little bit more of an animalistic look with pointy tips and inhuman flexibility that allows him to wiggle and flick them expressively. You can make out a small silver earring dangling from the one on the right side. Talov's horns are mostly straight up from the top of his head, only bending in a light arch towards the back.";

to say Kerr & Talov Background:
	say "     Hearing your question about their background, Talov smiles and gives a little nod. 'I can see why you'd want to get to know more about us. We met recently and all that. Let's see where best to start.' Pressing his lips together as he thinks, the satyr then looks up at Kerr, with a happy smile appearing on his face immediately. 'Okay, let's do the basics first. I'm Talov Byrne, and this sexy mountain of a man is my husband, Cian Kerrigan.' There is a little huff from the brown-furred satyr at those last words, with him rolling his eyes a little bit, but then putting on a friendly expression as he says, 'Just Kerr is fine, bro. Only my dad and mom use the first name, when they want to nag me about something.' Putting a hand on his husband's muscular arm to soothe his slight irritation with a gentle stroke, to be answered by a small flex of Kerr's arm around him, Talov continues, 'I still think it's a beautiful name. But yeah, please just call him Kerr.'";
	say "     Talov looks at you and gives a little nod to go ahead with using his partner's preferred name, as he himself does to make Kerr happy. Then the satyr continues, 'Anyways, just a short while ago, we were like any other two gay guys in this city. Just living our lives, working the daily grind. Kerr does, err... did, construction and I was one of the archivists in the big museum downtown.' By his expression and the somewhat sighing breath he takes, you can tell that Talov must have found his occupation in the place a bit boring. 'And that's where I was, dusting off an ancient piece of native American pottery when things began to go down with our current situation. I freely admit that it surprised the fuck out of me. I mean, the backrooms are locked, but someone was making a racket towards the entrance. Sounded like they brought a horse or something, hooves on the floor tiles. Wasn't I surprised when I stuck my head out of the room and saw three half-naked guys approach me - my colleague Lionel, Hughes the security guard, and some other dude.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Kerr jumps in at that point, commenting, 'He must have thought his fantasies came true. Talov's shown me a pic or two of Hughes, that guy's absolute man-candy. There may have been a day or two on which my man came home all hot and bothered after watching Hughes take his shirt off in the summer and help with some lifting. Man, that was good sex afterwards, hah!' Grinning and stretching himself up a little to give the other satyr a kiss on the cheek, Talov adds, 'What can I say, I got a type. And I married the best of the muscle hunks.' Then he turns back to you and continues, 'Anyways, the guys were all satyrized, clothes askew and with shoes kicked off to reveal their hooves. They were holding what looked like some of the Mexican-colonial drinking cups from the exhibits, sloshing with liquid. Can you believe that they'd just grab historical artifacts like that?!' Chuckling a little, Kerr squeezes his partner's shoulder and throws in, 'Babe, it's alright. I'm sure they didn't mean no disrespect.'";
	say "     Nodding, Talov lets out a sigh, 'Guess being freshly transformed is a little bit of an excuse, fine. Also, they were pretty wasted. Must have chugged a bunch of the wine in their cups, and they drunkenly told me I just had to try it too. I really thought it was some sort of elaborate prank or something. You know, shock the socks off the gay archivist and tease him with some skin. While I was still frozen to stare, they closed in on me. I started to tell them to cut it out, and tried to pull off their 'disguises', only to be shocked when the fur didn't come off. In retrospect, I guess they thought I was groping them and they began rubbing up against me, with some very nice and hairy chests to be honest. Still, as I was trying to push em off and wanted to remind them that Kerr and I are an item, the first cup of satyr wine was poured down my throat, with more splashing all over myself and soaking me to my skin.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Well, long story short, the guys weren't really rapey or anything... just a bit overly enthusiastic, and well... pretty gay for two straight guys.' Sliding his arm around Talov in a bit of a protective gesture, Kerr sighs, 'Wish I'd chosen to bring you lunch that day. Then I could have shown them what was what and you wouldn't have needed to wrestle them off yourself.' His husband gives him a thankful smile, then goes on to say, 'Now, I had no plans to cheat on my hubby, despite my thoughts going a bit hazy at that point, and feeling pretty horny all of a sudden. So after pushing aside another attempt from Hughes to kiss me on the lips, I finally got through to them that I wasn't down for this and they let me go. Soaked in wine and dripping it over the floorplates, I sprinted out of there. Imagine my surprise when I got away from the freaky stuff going on inside the museum, and then stepping out the front gate and seeing a dragon-thing swoop down and snatch up a whole car in its talons. So it wasn't just in one place, but everywhere!'";
	say "     'That's when I started to really worry, about Kerr. What might be going on with him, and all that. Made a beeline straight away for home as fast as I could. There were a lot of weird things happening all around, but didn't care for anything except getting to him.' Giving the other man a comforting rub of his tail, the larger satyr takes over at that point. 'Meanwhile, I was just at home and listening to a radio show that was reporting about strange occurrences happening. Then I heard Talov shout my name and hurriedly throw open the door to the apartment. He stormed in and basically jumped me, wrapping his arms around me and burbling something about being happy I was safe, and satyrs at the museum, and the wine that had his clothes plastered to his skin. That's when it really hit me, that whatever was being talked about on the radio was actually real - because I saw that he had horns. Just little ones yet, but... horns, on his head, right here.' Blowing out his breath, the large man places a hand on Talov's hair, fingers gently rubbing the base of his horns.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Ooh yeah, love when you do that, babe!' Talov almost purrs, clearly enjoying the touch. He even closes his eyes for a moment, just reveling in the feelings Kerr's caress gives him, before blinking them back open and focusing on you again. 'So yeah, I was still a bit of a mess at that point. Mind all blurry, and after worrying all the way home and then seeing him, safe and sound, I kinda went to pieces for a little while. As he said, I didn't make that much sense and... I guess that just woke his protector instincts or something, hah! Before I knew what was what, he'd thrown me over his shoulder and carried my wine-soaked self to the bathroom. The shirt came off, then my undershirt, and into the shower we went, him not even thinking about his own clothes as he wrenched on the hot water and gave me a scrub-down. Got stripped all the way, washed and dried, then he asked me to just sit down for a moment as he closed all the blinds, barricaded the front door and everything.'";
	say "     Kerr shrugs, 'What can I say, I was freaking out at that point. He was totally out of it, and not making any sense with what he was saying. Even the water didn't really sober him up either. It didn't help that I could literally see him changing before my eyes. He's always been pretty light in the body hair department-' 'Just how he likes it,' Talov throws in, stroking a hand over his own chest and winking at you. 'So it wasn't hard to see that something was going on about his legs. My man was getting more and more furry down there by the moment. It wasn't human hair either, no curl to it and whatnot. I didn't know what to do, so I just sat with him, held him tight and kept telling him and myself things were going to be okay. Guess at some point, we dozed off like that, on our sofa.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Hugging Kerr with one arm, Talov takes over and says, 'Must have been a few hours later when I woke up again, feeling safe and secure in my hubby's arms. It was like nothing could have happened to me, if I was protected by those strong arms. Went through all sorts of weird stuff while asleep, so I kinda thought meeting the satyrs in the museum was part of it. You know, just a dream, and that it was over and I was just at home, with the one I love. So then I slid up a bit, and kissed his lips.' 'Best way to be woken up by far, I can tell you that. Makes ya feel like a fairytale prince,' Kerr adds in, then plants a quick peck on his husband's cheek. 'So, there we were, kissing each other and smiling, but I kept wondering why he was looking up at my hair again and again, so I tried to run a hand through it, and found my horns, fully grown as they are now. It was kinda frightening, how I didn't even notice them before then, as if they'd always been there my whole life. So I realized that what happened at the museum... actually happened, and our world was in the middle of changing quite a bit.'";
	say "     'Anyways, straining to remember everything with a mind that was much clearer after resting, I told Kerr all about what happened at the museum, and what flashes I could recall about the way back home.' Clearing his throat, Kerr takes over, 'I got a little angry, about those guys putting their hands on my man. Hell, I met Hughes and Lionel during one event or other at the museum. Seemed like normal people, and totally straight as well - and then I heard about em rubbing up against Talov, pouring wine into his mouth and all that.' Bumping his furry hip against Kerr's side with a smile on his face, Talov breaks him out of the rant and throws in, 'I really think they weren't in their right minds either. Freshly transformed, and moderately wasted. Remember, they didn't really do anything more and let me go.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Visibly calming down, Kerr continues to say, 'After hearing the story about what happened, with him being... infected somehow, to become a satyr. At the time, we Had no idea how that could have happened, if it was just him being close to those other guys, or what else. I'd been wondering if I could or would catch it from him. But when that expression of fear came over his face, I realized that I didn't care at all. I'd be with him, no matter what. So, I kissed him back, and wrapped my arms around him tight. We started making out, and soon I was feeling his best piece poking me in the abs, hah!' Talov smirks at you and says with a wink, 'He grabbed it, and brushed his thumb over the head, really winding me up fiercely. Then he showed my that sexy, bearded grin I love so much, and asked me to fuck him. Things went a bit wild after that. Ya know, [']life-reaffirming bonding['] also known as pounding each other's brains out. We've always both been verse, but someone discovered just how much he likes having two handfuls of furry booty to squeeze as he pulls me deeper into him.'";
	say "     Flushing a little, Kerr adds with good-natured amusement, 'What can I say, he's just so loaded with energy now, and can just go on and on and on. Yeah, I might have developed a slight preference for bottoming now. No shame about it.' He lowers a hand to tickle the other satyr's side, teasing Talov back, before going on to say, 'It won't surprise you that by the time that day ended, we were both satyrs. Haven't regretted it for even a second, I can tell you that.' 'We did have some other fun surprises when exploring satyr-sex for the first time, but maybe that's something to talk about another time...' Talov adds with a wink at the end.";
	TraitGain "Backstory Told" for Kerr & Talov;

to say Kerr & Talov Barrel:
	say "     Having wondered where they got their large barrel of satyr wine from in the first place, you ask the two satyrs about it, which puts a proud grin on Kerr's face. He pushes his chest out a bit and nods to you, then says with a playful smirk on his face, 'Now, I don't want to claim all the credit for getting the barrel, however I made the most important contribution to it: Ya see, I popped the question for a certain man to marry me.' Confused about what he means, you look back and forth between the two of them. Kerr flushes a little as his joke seems to have fallen flat, clearing his throat and saying, 'What I wanted to say is Talov's not just sexy as fuck, but smart too. Tell us about it, babe!' With that, the muscular satyr slides an arm around his partner and pulls him close, then pats him on the chest with the free hand. Talov chuckles while rolling his eyes, shaking his head at the antics of his husband.";
	say "     Then he leans in against Kerr and snakes his left arm behind the other man, likely to grope him a little. 'Well, having a graduate degree in history did help a bit, yeah. You see, I started wondering what might be causing all of this. We had turned into beings basically plucked right out of myths, and just looking out the window from our place, there seemed an awful lot of [']otherworldly['] beings around all of a sudden. That got me thinking that there might be more to the old myths than just fancy stories. Something to investigate, for sure. I went through my books, but as I'd focused on pre-colonial and colonial American history for my degree, there were some limits to what was in there. Some native-American myths matched what was out there - saw a man stroll by with the head of a coyote, and others with tails and whatnot, but I really needed more research material.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'For this part, I actually did help,' Kerr throws in, flexing his bicep in a demonstrative way. 'Wrestled a dog-dude into submission who tried to jump us on the way to the nearest library. Was a little bit off balance at first, as I didn't have feet anymore but hooves instead, and you have less grip on the ground with those, making a proper grapple harder. He got away from me at first, throwing me off and then tried to jump on top. That's when I learned that a proper back-kick as a satyr really packs a punch! He went down fast, hah! That puppy learned quick that he bit off more than he could chew! After that, I made sure to check our route for people lying in ambush, and to give everyone looking sketchy hard stares to frighten them off.' Talov comments, 'That's my sweet hubby, looking out for us! Good thing libraries apparently are too boring to draw any looters, otherwise I don't think I'd have gotten around do doing any research at all. I always loved watching him wrestle! The flex of those muscles, and seeing a shiny sheen of sweat on his chest. Mmmh!'";
	say "     Kerr's eyes widen in that moment and he stands up a little straighter, likely from having his buttocks pinched. With a chuckle, he tells his husband, 'Focus, babe. You're supposed to tell a story, remember?' Smiling and sticking out his tongue at the other satyr, Talov continues, 'Anyways, a few hours and two dozen books later, I had a list of rituals to try. First two were duds, but number three... that one called for befriending a satyr to lead you through the steps, and well, just look at us. So we tried it!' 'Dancing naked in a circle scratched into the dirt in a nearby park, you mean?' Kerr interrupts with a grin, then goes on to say, 'When we did that, it started. Beckoning sounds, of a pan flute. Always seeming to come from just out of sight - around a corner, behind a car, and so on. And it wasn't just someone playing tricks on us with a music player. Kinda scary, but exciting at the same time! Talov could hear it, as could I, but when we asked some of the friendlier-looking people on the street, they could not.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Wiggling his eyebrows at you, expressing his excitement at having found something supernatural but real, Talov takes over the story. 'The music was having some... interesting effects too. I mean, we both felt pretty horny and were half-hard just from it alone. Nothing one couldn't control, like in some of the stories I'd read about satyrs being rather forceful and not taking no as an answer. Just kinda having a light buzz, and stroking a little on the side. So off we went, following the music, and that led us right to the museum! I've worked at that place for over two years and know it well. But when we were barely three rooms in to the exhibition spaces, the flute drew us to a hallway branching off to the side... which shouldn't have existed. There was supposed to be blank wall in that spot, with the outside of the building on the other side!'";
	say "     'Room after room as we went further, our surroundings became less the place I knew, and more something else. Darker, more primal and wild, with the polished stone of the museum giving place to walls of stone blocks, with torches on the walls, and artifacts laid out on tables looked almost... new, as if we were moving back through the centuries or something. Then finally, we saw a rough-cut wooden door standing partially open, as if to invite us inside. Stepping through it, there was no building at all behind, but a forest. Moss and soil underneath our hooves, and ancient trees all around, with an evening sky above.' Clearing his throat to get your attention, Kerr pulls his arm from around his husband and takes a step to the side, then explains, 'He's not joking when he says [italic type]ancient[roman type]! They were something else entirely! I mean...' he stretches his arms out to the sides, reaching an impressive width and showing off his muscular chest. 'It'd take about six of me to go around one of those trees! And they weren't any type of 'special' giant trees like redwoods either, but 'just' regular ones. Oak, cherry, cedar, and so on, all left to grow undisturbed, for a long, long time...'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'It was pretty awe-inspiring to be there, to be honest. Gives you a whole new feeling of respect for nature, if you're the youngest thing around by a few thousand years. We kinda just wandered through the wood for a while, gaping and staring at our surroundings, while the blue of the sky started to fade as night approached.' It's clear just how impressed both of the satyrs are, given their eager expressions as they simply returning to the place in memory. Talov steps forward to say, 'One would have thought being alone in an unknown forest would be frightening, especially after nightfall with unseen animals starting to make noise, but it just... felt like home. And it wasn't long before we saw some light, in the distance, behind the trees. It was a large bonfire, with the tall, dancing flames drawing us in. Above the crackling and burning, we could hear the voices of others already there, singing and laughing. And behind it all, the deep, full sound of the flute again, accompanied by drums and other instrument now.'";
	say "     'Stepping out between the trees into the large clearing, we saw what must have been a few dozen people, enjoying themselves in a roaring festival. Singing, eating, dancing, making music, or just fucking if the mood struck them. I'm talking satyrs, nymphs, dryads, centaurs, and all sorts of creatures I didn't even recognize here! All of them being jovial and happy as they enjoyed their celebration. It was really nice to see all of them, happy in their skin as they were, not like in the city we'd come from, where people were often still coming to terms with what they had become. They noticed us in turn, and just gave friendly waves and calls, ready to accept us into the party without any hesitation. It was nice to see them all like that, and be welcomed.' The two men before you share a happy smile, with Kerr taking Talov's hand in his own and giving it a squeeze.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Taking a deep breath, Talov then looks at you with an intense look in his eyes as he says, 'And in the midst of it all, leading the dance around the fire with his pipes playing a fast tune, was Pan himself. Just looking at him made it clear who and what he was. You could literally feel the power radiating off him, like the warm glow of the sun, and he was plenty sexy too.' Chuckling, Kerr quips, 'Careful, or I might get jealous of you drooling after our big satyr daddy! Guess I'll have to so something so you don't run off to him!' Then he puts his hands on Talov's hips and literally picks him up, drawing him close against his chest. The red-headed satyr laughs joyfully and wraps his legs around Kerr's body, then leans down to kiss him deeply. The two of them make out for a moment, giving each other plenty of tongue, before Kerr eventually clears his throat and nods his head in your direction. Talov blushes at little at having almost forgotten you were there, too entranced in the moment and enjoying himself while held in the strong arms of his husband.";
	say "     'I wanted to ask so many questions, about him, and what happened to us, and what was going on in the world, and... yeah, maybe just wanted to touch him too, and bury my fingers in the sexy hair curling on his chest. Though when we moved forward, the people in the crowd pretty much grabbed our hands and pulled us into the dancing. And that was fine really, the music felt so right to go along with, do dance with my hubby right beside me, and forget about anything else for a while.' Grinning widely, Kerr winks at you and adds, 'We had a really, really good time there. Danced for I don't know how long, into the night. Pan even acknowledged us, smiling and with a twinkle in his eyes waved us forward to dance to a solo he was playing! Then we had some of the food, and after that...'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Talov jumps in to say, 'One of the hunky satyr dudes approached us and just really casually asked if we could 69 each other, hah! You should have seen how red Kerr got in the face as he heard that!' Kerr flushes a little in embarrassment, with Talov just smiling at him and caressing his cheek and bearded face, showing that he's just teasing him good-naturedly. 'Guess what the satyr replied when Kerr told him we're an item? He cheerfully said 'Awesome! I'm really happy for you! Want me to service you both together then?' Kinda gave us something to think about, that eager 'free love' approach of the guy. I looked at Kerr, he looked at me, and... we realized that the dude was hot and each of us was kinda interested. So I grabbed his arm and pulled him to the side to have a little talk, if we were both alright with this. He was really sweet about it, telling me that he wouldn't do anything if I wasn't on board.' The two of them smile at each other, clearly happy about their relationship and comfortable with the decisions that they made back then.";
	say "     Clearing his throat, Kerr holds up one hand and counts points off his fingers. 'So, here's the rules we agreed on: First, we're only ever going to do stuff together. Its not cheating as long as we're both present, but anything else is off limits. Second, no kissing - these lips belong only to the two of us. Third, we're gonna be the dominant ones when it comes to others. Don't want to see my man beg anyone but me for dick. But power-bottoming is fine. Fourth, fuckbuddies are not friends, they're something to play with, but we'll never hang out with them.' Talov nods in confirmation, 'Yup. Them's the rules. We're together and aren't looking for a third. But boning a fine piece of ass together is fine. So... ten minutes later or so, when we were done talking things through, we went back over to the guy. Grabbed him by the shoulder and pushed him to his knees, right then and there. He was pretty into being used publicly, smiling ecstatically as we presented him with two dicks at once. Didn't really stay at blowjobs either...'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Before long, we were spit-roasting him, and kissing each other as we filled the dude up from either end. That hunk really saw some action that night, I can tell you that! Hah, don't even know the guy's name, but that's best for a fuck buddy in the end. Got all the man to love I need right here and don't need another! The sex was pretty good though.' That said, he meets eyes with Kerr, who nods in confirmation, followed by the two of them kissing again. Setting his husband back onto his own hooves a moment later, Kerr turns his attention back to you. 'So there we lay, on a cushion of soft moss, sweaty and thoroughly worn out from the trip, dancing, fucking and all. That's when Pan stepped up close, looking a simple woodsman-type of way as he gazed down on our naked bodies and cum-matted fur, and smiled.'";
	say "     'Talov opened his mouth to ask him those questions, but the big satyr daddy just shook his head lightly, then said, 'You have already learned everything you need, young ones, simply by coming here. Just be free, live in the moment.' Yeah, yeah - I know it sounds pretty simple when I repeat those words, but believe me - when an actual god tells you something, that's really something!' Talov nods in confirmation, joining Kerr in trying to explain their conviction, 'It just kinda all fell into place then. The whole trip was his lesson. About believing in something, following where it led, and realizing that nature is so much greater than each of us. Then joining the celebration and experiencing its uncomplicated joy, including our fling with the satyr dude.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'Pan seemed to approve of seeing our expressions when those insights struck us. 'Now you get it!' he said with a wide grin, making finger guns at the two of us. 'For so long, humans have become so depressingly rational, so controlled. Only very few would even listen to my song, far less follow it. But looking at you, things have clearly changed. Humans, but wearing the forms of my followers, and you calling out to me, then going all the way to come here.' Stroking his beard thoughtfully, he then added, 'Maybe it is about time, for the world to become wild once more. Less stale, and controlled. Yes, let's try that!' Nodding to himself, confident he made the right decision, Pan finally said, 'I'll give the two of you a present too. It will never run empty, as long as you believe.' Then he raised the flutes to his lips and started playing a slow, quieter song than before, which put us to sleep in fairly short notice.' Kerr then adds, 'When we woke up, we were in that circle we did the ritual in, in the park near our place. And the barrel was waiting for us, right there next to where we lay. So now you know the epic origin story of how we got it, hah!'";
	TraitGain "Rules Mentioned" for Kerr & Talov;

to say Kerr & Talov College:
	say "     Curiosity drives you to ask why they decided to come to the college campus, and specifically the PAN frat, which prompts Talov to reach out and slip his hand under Kerr's larger one, entwining their fingers. 'That's easy, it's where I met my hubby. Ehm, in college I mean, not this frat. Though there were some... memorable nights here.' With a little chuckle, Kerr raises their clasped hands up to kiss the back of Talov's hand, then looks at his husband and raises an eyebrow. 'Babe, I think they want a little bit more than just the short and cheesy answer. If it'd have been just that, we'd have gone over to... hm, what was your room number again? 203?' Talov smiles and replies amusedly, '206 actually. Hah, I can just imagine rocking up to the door there and knocking on it, then saying [']Hey, me and my man here want to relive our first time having sex. Could ya give us the room for half a day or so?['] Bet that'd go over smoothly. Well, or they might just want to watch.'";
	say "     'You naughty boy,' Kerr says half-jokingly and somewhat dreamily as he thinks back to the time in question. 'Anyways, after we transformed and saw how things went as more days passed since the start of the outbreak, it became really obvious that the world wouldn't just go back to the way it used to be. And well, then we went to go meet the great kahuna - big satyr-daddy Pan himself. His advice really struck a cord with Talov and me. [']Be free, live in the moment.['] he said. So we got to thinking, about when we did have the best time of our lives. And that really was in college.' Talov lets out a sigh, then explains, 'You know, before falling into the nine to five grind of having a normal job. Dreaming about making big archeologic discoveries, not sorting through other people's old finds gathering dust in museum drawers.'

With Kerr now dominating more or less all of your senses, you're easily led along by Talov, guiding you with the hand on your neck to move further up his husband's chest, to the protruding bumps of his pecs. 'Suck on it!' Talov commands as your tongue brushes over a nipple you were brought to, and you obediently pucker your lips to cover the dark circle on Kerr's chest. As you flick the tip of your tongue over the protruding nub in the middle, then start to suckle, you make the rhythm of Kerr's lifting get out of step a little, soon faltering completely as he sets down the weights in their rack with a solid metal-on-metal thunk. It feels really nice to know that the heavy breathing of the man from now on comes from what you're doing, no longer the simple exertion of his muscles.";
	say "     Talov guides you to the other nipple after a little while, making sure that it's getting a suitable bit of attention too, then eventually pulls you down over Kerr's abs again. As you trace a trail over the satyr's skin with your tongue, you soon feel something warm and wet bump the side of your cheek, leaving a sensation of wetness at the point of contact. Turning your gaze, you find yourself eye to eye with the throbbing dickhead of Kerr's thick piece of man-meat, its cum-slit seemingly looking at you as another bit of pre-cum wells up from its depths, increasing the wetness clinging to the head a little more, then dripping down onto his abs right before your eyes. 'Mmmhh!' you can hear in a pleasant rumble at the touch filling the black satyr's chest, followed by Talov pressing your face down once more. Easily guessing at what is expected of you, your tongue gets licking once again, slurping up the small puddle of pre that Kerr leaked onto himself while you were worshiping his chest.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Taste-buds tingling with the taste of the satyr's pre-cum, you find yourself eager for more, and without any need for prompting, you raise your head after licking up the last, then slide your lips over Kerr's dickhead and suckle on it. More of his tasty treat floods over your tongue and is quickly swallowed, with Talov then helping things along too by pushing your head further onto his partner's erection. Kerr meanwhile moans in well-pleased satisfaction, with his hips thrusting up a little to push deeper into your mouth. You lose yourself for a little while in orally pleasing the man, only vaguely registering the two satyrs['] words when Kerr eventually says, 'The blowjob's great, but I wanna fuck now, hobi.' and Talov replies, 'Anything for you, babe!' That said, he taps your shoulder and pulls you off his husband's cock. Turning your head to look at the red-headed satyr, you see that he's hard as a rock himself, sporting a somewhat more 'normal-sized' erection, thinner than Kerr's, but equally dripping with pre.";
	say "     'Go on, get your ass up and straddle him,' the satyr tells you in an expectant tone, smiling as you obey and swing a leg over Kerr. Stretched out on his back beneath you, the large man is happy enough to let his lover command the action. His arms are raised and he has the fingers oh his hands intertwined and underneath his head, allowing him to grin at you quite comfortably and exposing the relatively lightly haired pits of his arms. Feeling the warmth of the man's heated body against your crotch and inner thighs, you start to feel around for his cock behind you, only to have Talov intercept your hand and push your chest forward instead. He directs your movement to place you face-first in Kerr's left armpit and making you huff his musky scent. More or less on autopilot, you begin lapping again, drawing a mixture of pleased pants and little giggles as you tickle Kerr a little. At the same time, you hear the second satyr gather a gob of saliva, then spitting it at your crack, spreading the wetness over your pucker as improvised lube.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     A few more wads of spit are added as Talov pushes his fingers into your hole to open you up a little, then soon replaces those digits with the thicker and much warmer sensation of Kerr's dickhead against your back door. It gets pressed in against your pucker, which opens up to allow the large invader after a tiny token of resistance before it allows itself to be spread around his girthy mushroom head. Happy to be used as their cock-sheath like this, you rock back to envelop more of Kerr's erection even before Talov repositions his hands to the sides of your hips, pulling you even deeper onto the impaling shaft. It stretches you so very good around the thick girth, throbbing inside you as more pre-cum wells up and lubricates your hole for easier and easier sliding in and out. The next little while of your day is filled by focusing on the big cock in your ass and the musky armpit you're huffing and licking, with Talov making you switch to the other pit once or twice.";
	say "     After you don't know how long, something changes, as a furry warmth suddenly presses against the backs of your thighs. It's the fur of Kerr's thighs as his legs are raised and spread, with Talov moving into position between them. 'Take my ass, hubby!' Kerr pants eagerly, followed by an ecstatic grunt as his husband slides home into the welcoming hole between his buttocks. You can feel the second satyr up close right behind you, his flat stomach touching your ass every time he bottoms out inside his man. You can feel the force of his thrusts inside your own body too, transmitted through Kerr's own movements, and also the way his dick seems to become [italic type]even thicker[roman type] every time Talov hits his prostate, throbbing hard inside you as that happens. The movements in your shared three-way fuck ramp up quickly as everyone's libido flares up to a bright blaze of orgasmic energy. Together, you fill the basement gym with grunts, moans and the slapping noises of skin on skin.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You're in a pretty sweet place mentally, impaled on a hard cock and still huffing Kerr's musky scent, when you suddenly feel yourself being literally sandwiched between the two men. Talov is leaning forward on top of you, pressing you down, and Kerr uses one hand to keep your face pressed against his armpit while he pushes his chest up. With some stretching, this allows the two of them to bring their heads close enough to start making out with each other, moaning things 'I love you babe!' as well as 'And I you, habi!' Their intimate moment prompts Talov to rabbit-fuck his husband's sensitive hole at a frantic speed, building up to an explosive orgasm of him pumping a heavy load into his partner's innermost depths, which pushes Kerr's buttons [italic type]hard[roman type] and makes him buck up against you violently, joining his lover in climax just moments after. You can feel a flood of cum welling up from his large, furry balls, gushing warmly into your stretched passage and giving you a pleasant sensation of fullness.";
	say "     With the two of them mainly being focused on each other, you decide to give yourself the last little push you need to get off yourself. Snaking a hand between yourself and Kerr, you grasp your [Cock of Player] member and jerk it in impatient haste. As close as you already were, and with the throb, throb, throb of Kerr's cock unloading more cum into you still stimulating your hole, it doesn't take much before you let out a grunt of arousal against Kerr's armpit while your cock sprays out its own volley of creamy spurts between your close-together chests. As the urgent need to come is quenched, you ride out your orgasm in pleasant relaxation, just leaving everything else to the two men that used you as their fuck-toy just now. There is a while longer of being sandwiched between them, as they kiss and stroke each other, cocks resting in freshly bred holes. Then eventually, Talov pulls away and Kerr lifts you off his body, his cock pulling out with a wet slurp.";

	say "     Standing up from the weightlifting bench, Kerr takes a deep breath, then says with a grin, 'That was a good workout - and a whole lot of fun!' Talov kisses his lips and replies, 'Don't you know it, babe!' He slides an arm around his naked partner, glancing over towards the door leading to the shower room. Then he hesitates to glance over his shoulder, taking in the bench, wet with sweat and a few specks of cum. 'We're gonna go shower and freshen up. Could you give the equipment a wipe-down please, before you do the same? Wouldn't want to leave the guys with spots on their stuff, we're all guests here, eh?' Giving the man an obedient nod, you walk over to where Kerr left his towel, collecting it to clean up the aftermath of your little threesome - both the equipment as well as yourself, before you leave a trail of cum dripping from your used hole. After that, you make your way to the showers too, passing the satyrs halfway as they come out, clean but somewhat damp.";
	say "     Satisfied about your role in the threesome, and the fact that you cleaned up, they both give you a nod and smile in passing, then move to climb up the stairs, all the while joking with each other about getting back to the party. You're left to scrub yourself after that, then collect your stuff and join the satyrs back at the bar a while later.";

to say Kerr & Talov Livingroom Pounding:
	say "     Stepping up to Talov, you straight away reach out and grope for his crotch, feeling the currently soft cock and cupping his nice pair of balls covered in red fur. The satyr has his hands full right now, mixing drinks and then handing them to Kerr to hand out, but he clearly appreciates your hands-on approach, throwing you a grin to the side while trying not to spill too much because of the distraction. His shaft fills out quickly in your hand, standing hard and erect as you glide your fingers up and down its length. 'Damn, this dude is giving the barman a handjob!' you can hear one of the waiting students shout to be heard over the din of the music, drawing the attention of several more people, who turn their gaze to watch what's going on. A flush of being exposed to all of them crosses your face, but you can't help but feel excited by it too, so you put on a little bit of a smile and continue fondling the satyr's cock, a bit more openly now. Leaning in towards you, Talov says loudly, 'You like having a crowd, hah!' and chuckles as you give a confirming nod.";
	say "     Talov finishes off the next few drink requests he got, handing out the cups while you're stroking his cock, then soon puts two fingers in his mouth to give a sharp whistle, cutting through the music and drawing Kerr's attention from the other end of the bar. 'This is only the beginning!' he calls out to the crowd, then meets Kerr's eyes and gives a meaningful nod towards you. A broad smile spreads over the black satyr's bearded face and he walks closer on his heavy hooves, his own cock already starting to chub up as he sees the state you've got his husband in. The big man wastes little time with words, given how loud it is in here and therefore hard to have a conversation, instead simply starting to pull your [if Player is not naked]clothes and [end if]gear off, shoving it under the bar and out of the way. Wolf whistles, laughs and whoops sound from the watching crowd as they follow you being stripped down right in front of them.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Soon all three of you are bare-ass naked, with everyone's cock being hard and starting to leak pre-cum. At some point, your other hand found its way to encircle Kerr's shaft in turn, stroking both of them at the same time while the two satyrs paw and grope your body. Kerr and Talov exchange some looks with one another and grin, then they suddenly each raise one balled fist in front of you. 'Three! Two! One!' Kerr bellows in his deep voice, with them shaking their hands up and down at the count. While the larger satyr keeps his fist balled, his partner opens his hand and straightens the fingers to a flat plane, before gripping Kerr's fist and shouting, 'Paper wraps Rock!' The two satyrs burst into a laugh, followed by Talov swiping his arm over the counter-space behind the bar, clearing it in an avalanche of empty red cups. This makes room for Kerr to move you into place, gripping you by the shoulder to bend you forward.";
	say "     Bracing on the counter puts you face to face with the crowd watching excitedly, mostly dudes but also a some women, with more than a few people having pulled out smartphones to record what's going on. Glancing behind you for a second, you can see Talov stepping up right behind you, one hand on the base of his cock to guide it between your buttocks. The satyr gathers a large gob of spit, letting it drip down from the tip of his flexible tongue to land in your crack. Then he brushes his dickhead up and down over your rear entrance, spreading the wetness as a little bit of improvised lube, together with his own pre-cum. Lining his cock up with your pucker, you can feel his erection push in a little against it, not quite enough to penetrate for now. Then Talov places a finger on Kerr's jaw, making him turn his head so they can kiss each other on the mouth, with plenty of tongue too, as he sticks his appendage between Kerr's lips and the larger man sucks on it.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     The satyrs['] impromptu make-out session ends when Kerr pulls back after a little while, smiling broadly at Talov and shouting, 'Warm his ass up for me, sexy!' And with that, he gives his husband a playful slap on the furry buttocks, prompting Talov to thrust forward and bury half his length inside your gripping hole. Even though you knew it was coming at some point, the sudden penetration makes you gasp out loud as you wrestle with the sensations of having your insides spread around the invading shaft. Several flashes of light from smartphones in picture mode serve to immortalize the moment forever, as the watchers will surely share their pics and recording with everyone they know. Not that you waste too much time thinking about that, as your concentration is fully occupied by the long piece of man-meat pressing further and further into you, until Talov's curly pubic hair soon pushes against your ass.";
	say "     'Love the tight grip of your insides,' the satyr calls out in a somewhat breathless compliment, patting your side before starting to fuck your ass in earnest. You tremble as his long, slender cock pulls back, with the rim of his mushroom head brushing along the walls of your chute, opening it up just that little bit more than the girth of his shaft. Then it reaches the ring of your pucker, nudging against it from the inside, with Talov teasingly pulling against it, lightly and in the beat of the music droning on around you. With shocking suddenness, he suddenly proceeds to wrench his dickhead past your opening, making you gasp as it is forced wide to let the invading member past. It feels odd to be so empty all of a sudden, and your ring muscle seems to almost be confused about what to do for a second, gaping open, then pulling tight in reflex, before loosening itself once more - which is just when the horny satyr rams himself back into you again!";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     Talov fucks you playfully, moving in rhythm with the music, so you're rabbit-fucked along a staccato beat in one moment, then experience slower but deeper, hard and powerful thrusts as the next song starts to play. And all the while the crowd seems to almost take part, bobbing their heads or dancing to the same rhythm you're being shafted to, and calling out cheers and laughs to spur Talov on to give it to you good. In between, a few of them even step right up to you, raising cups with drinks for you to take a swallow from, or sometimes more like sloshing something into your open mouth, or onto your chin, chest, shoulders, etc. - they're not all that great in aiming, being sloshed themselves and/or moving to the beat. It is after another splash of beer to the face, with you having to wipe it of with the back of your hand, when you notice that the thrusting against your ass slowed down, followed by the satyr pulling out fully once more.";
	say "     Wondering about what's going on, you glance behind you and see the two satyrs kissing, followed by Talov pulling Kerr over to take his place fucking you. Noticing your attention, the dark-skinned satyr gives you a grinning nod, then slaps his erect cock against the crack of your ass a few times, running it up and down between your buns. Knowing that he's markedly thicker than his partner, and even feeling it a little bit, from the touch of his cock along your crack, you bite your lip and brace yourself - just in time, as Kerr makes full use of the fact that you've been warmed up, and opened up already. His beer-can of a schlong is hammered into your insides with a smooth thrust, driving a deep grunt from your lungs as you force yourself not to let out a whorish moan instead. 'Woot! Someone's getting cornholed hard, haha! Look how wide his eyes are getting!' one of the amused audience-members shouts out, and he's not wrong either. Definitely feels like a whole new level of stretch as Kerr temporarily rearranges your insides!";

Uh-oh, feels like he's getting a good grip to fuck you with full force. And indeed, it doesn't take more than a short moment after he bottoms out before the man begins to withdraw slowly, then thrusts himself home in one fell swoop, keeping your body steady with his gripping hands. 'They're making a chain out of it now!' a spectator adds next, telling you that Talov's sliding his slickened shaft up his husband's rear end in turn, which doubles the sensations for Kerr, as he impales his ass with every withdraw, then sinks deep into your hole again with every thrust of his hips! And thrust he does, vigorously, giving you a relentless pounding with that thick shaft.";
	say "     Between the two sexy satyrs making use of your ass, a whole crowd of eager onlookers and the beat of the music pulsing through your whole body, you find yourself in a kind of lusty haze, losing any real track of time. The situation you landed yourself in could be called a literal wet dream for any exhibitionistic bottom, and you gotta say that you're having a bunch of fun yourself. Lights flash around you as more people take pictures or full-on video recordings, and you find yourself laughing and smiling at them, in between making whorish and lewd expressions when Kerr hits your prostate once again. As much as you wish to stay forever in this blissful state of sexual satisfaction, you vaguely register hearing someone shout, 'I'm coming baby!' That was Talov, as it turns out, loudly announcing what's happening as he wraps his arms around his husband from behind, hips grinding against the other satyr's ass as he erupts into him with full force.";
	WaitLineBreak;

Almost unbelievably, the thick, hard cock inside your ass can get a little girthier still, pushing against your inner walls with every heavy throb of Kerr's cum blasting into your hungry hole. He never stops pumping his cock in and out of you either, driving the creamy load deeper and deeper into you, with more cum being added all the time. Wanting to join the two satyrs in their sweet release, you slide a hand down to your own crotch and take hold of your rock-hard [Cock of Player] shaft, franticly jerking it to complete your need to come. Given how wound up you already are, it doesn't take long at all before you feel a familiar tingle rise inside you, followed by an eruption of cum showering everything under the work-counter of the bar.";
	say "     For a little while, you just stand where you are, leaning on the bar and catching your breath, much to the amusement of the crowd. Though now that the heavy action is over, many of them soon focus on other things, like dancing, loudly chatting about how much of a slut you are, and of course drinking - with the latter leading to lots of new requests to be served by the satyrs. It doesn't take long before Kerr withdraws his still fairly hard cock from your hole, freeing a small gush of his seed to leak out and trickle down the inside of your legs. 'Thanks man, just what we needed,' Talov tells you with a pinch of your buttocks, then throws himself back into satisfying all of the alcohol needs of the gathered college students. With the two of them busy now, you're left alone to gather up your gear [if Player is not naked]and clothes [end if]from beneath the bar, and with an armful of your somewhat sticky possessions make your way from behind the bar, having to duck past people trying to grab you to have some fun too. After a somewhat harrowing passage through the crowd, you clean yourself up at least a little bit in one of the restrooms.";
