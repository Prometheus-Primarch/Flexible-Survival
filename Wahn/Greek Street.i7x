to say greekdesc:
	say "     As suspected of a street with nothing but fraternities and sororities, your surroundings are moderately littered with plastic drinking cups, underwear, panties, and various sorts of trash. The buildings all around bear signs and banners with Greek letters, marking them as the homes of various groups. Letting your gaze sweep over the row of buildings, you recognize a pattern, with the fraternities lined up on the east side of the street, while the sororities are on the western side. Passing by the buildings you see a whole salad of Greek letters, with thankfully the English names spelled out beneath too. Inspecting the fraternities, you can see Phi Alpha Nu (PAN) being surprisingly well kept up, with its lawn and garden clean of litter and visibly greener than the surroundings. From the direction of Phi Iota Gamma (PIG), you hear some grunting, squealing and cheers coming from behind the building - might be some sort of fight or match going on there? Omicron Rho Chi (ORC) has a number of homemade banners fluttering in the wind, hung up on the front of the building - you recognize the stylized heads of a dragon, elves and orcs on a few of these.";
	say "     The Tau Omicron Psi (TOP) frat is the only one that has a fence all around it like a military compound (recently upgraded to actually include barbed wire, from the looks of it), with a tall flagpole and the building looking kinda utilitarian and barracks-like. Rho Upsilon Nu (RUN) has the logos of various sports teams plastered on the front wall of the building, with its mailbox literally sitting on the tip of a stand styled like one of those 'We're #1' foam hands. Lastly, the Alpha Lambda Epsilon (ALE) frat is extensively littered with empty liquor and beer bottles and cans, with an overflowing ashtray on the front porch. Checking out the sororities, you can see the outline of a woman apparently running side by side with a panther as a mural on the wall of 'The Pride' of Chi Alpha Tau (CAT). 'The Nereids' of Tau Iota Tau (TIT) is housed in a downright beautiful building, complete with decorative columns, little flags and steamers that flutter in the wind. Situated besides the previous building, 'The Maiar' of Delta Upsilon Delta (DUD) seems a bit... plain, with no special decoration or anything. Well-kept up but that's about it, just a residential house.";
	say "     While you'd love to explore all the various sororities and fraternities, you have no clue which ones are safe to enter. So you get the feeling that that it might be best for you to have a look around the campus to see if you can find information on the various groups at the college first instead of randomly walking up to any of the buildings...";

to say PFratBathroomDesc:
	say "     The communal bathroom of PAN frat-house is nicely spacious and kept pretty clean, speaking of some good discipline in the group's ranks, despite everything that is going on. It is clearly designed to be used by a number of the frat members at once, with for example a counter bearing three sinks side by side in front of a long mirror on the left. A similar number of toilets are on the right, each in what's basically its own little room with a proper door. A pretty big, green and healthy potted plant is standing beside the last door on that side too. Finally, the back end of the room holds a shower area behind a frosted-glass floor to ceiling wall with glass doors on the left and right. A quick glance inside reveals a clean, tiled interior, with three spots to shower at, equipped with both a ceiling-rain nozzle and a handheld one on a flexible hose. A sort of stone bench built into the back wall across the whole width of the group shower even allows people to sit down and just let the warm water rain down on them.";
	say "     Overall, quite a swanky setup with cut natural rock and whatnot. Though why not, you guess, as the frat clearly has some money to splash around, and in all likelihood someone put a lot of thought into fitting the place out like this. Overcrowded and cheap bathrooms can be a large source of conflict in communal living situations after all. A door to the [link]east[end link] leads back to the central room of the frat house's first floor. ";

	else:
		say "With the party in full swing and quite a bit of drinking going on, the amount of people coming in and out is noticeably high, mostly making beelines straight to the toilets sometimes waiting with strained expressions on their faces for one to free up. At times, someone who's pretty wasted is dragged to the showers and hosed down with cold water, either to clean or sober them up a bit. And of course, there are some instances in which people use the tentative 'privacy' one of the little restrooms or the shower cabin to do more lewd things to each other, if the sounds from within and the amused smirks people in the room share with each other are anything to go by.";
