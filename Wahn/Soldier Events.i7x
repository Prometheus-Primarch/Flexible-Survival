		say "     While exploring the second floor of an abandoned building in the city, you hear voices through one of the open windows. Peeking outside carefully so you're not spotted, you see five armed soldiers move through the alley behind the building. They're alert, but mostly keep their gaze level, observing what's in front of and behind them and not really looking up. Thus you can easily overhear them chatting with one another. 'Did you see the boobs on that last one? That's what I call a handful, eh Carl?!' one black-haired guy among the men jovially exclaims, nudging the blond soldier next to him. 'Yeah, maybe - but when she rubbed up against me, I felt something else beneath that skirt...' The first soldier snorts and says in a smarmy tone, 'There's always ass to have, even if you run into a t-girl!' Carl raises an eyebrow and shakes his head, 'We're not supposed to start things with civilians, Allen!' The first soldier shrugs and replies, 'It's not like we can catch anything, and she was literally begging for it.'";
		LineBreak;
		say "     [bold type]Do you want to continue listening?[roman type][line break]";
		LineBreak;
		say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Yeah, let's hear it all!";
		say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - You don't care about the men and have scavenging to do.";
		if player consents:
			say "     A third soldier with a completely shaved head says, 'Too weird for me, to make out with some sort of freak. Like going to the circus and smooching the bearded lady, eh?' Allen chuckles and looks over to him, 'Yeah, I can see that it'd be odd for you, Burt. Visiting your sister when she's on show and frenching her, haha!' The other man shows him the middle finger for the stupid joke, though he and the group do laugh about it - all except the one at the end of their marching line, who seems to be in some sort of distress. 'Man, it's hot today,' the pale-skinned man says to no one in particular, pulling on the collar of his uniform. You're a little surprised by this, as today is actually on the cooler side for the city, with a light breeze blowing from the sea. Sweat is running down over the man's face in visible beads, and he takes a deep, thirsty swig from his canteen. 'Really, fucking hot!' After pouring the rest of the water over his head, he flings the container aside, at which point the other men all turn to check on him.";
			say "     'What's up with you, Private Davies?!' Allen calls out, stepping up to the other man and grabbing him by the shoulder. 'Nnghh, feels like I'm burning inside, Sarge!' the distressed soldier groans, then shakes off the hand and starts to strip, dropping his weapon and backpack, followed by his jacket, then the olive tank-top covering his chest. This reveals the source of his discomfort - gray-white is rapidly sprouting from his skin, spreading in a slow but unstoppable wave over his front. Davies stares down at himself in shock, then falls to the floor, twitching and contorting himself in unnatural ways. The members of his squad watch in horror as the sounds of breaking and reforming bones echo in the alley, accompanied by groans and incomprehensible sounds from the transforming man. The other four soldiers become a weapon-bristling knot as they look first at each other for further infection, then all around in search of attackers. You quickly pull your head back, hoping that they didn't spot you.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     'Shit, what's going on?! Did those freaking nanite things evolve and overcome our boosters?' one man says, you think Carl. Then another throws in, 'Are we all going to end up like that? I didn't sign up to become some sort of monster!' 'Fuck no,' Burt adds to that, followed by a moment of overlapping voices saying things at the same time and which you do not understand. Then Allen cuts through the chaos with a shout, 'Shut the fuck up guys! Any of you feeling hot or weird? Carl? Burt? Ezra?' 'No sir!' Carl replies, with the other two men adding their own 'No!' right after. 'Okay, keep back while I check on him!' For a moment, you hear nothing but the transforming soldier's groans, then there's something else - a zipper? 'Oh, damn - did this stupid thing malfunction?' He pauses, then shouts, 'Soldiers, calm down! It's no new strain or attack - looks at this!' You peek down over the windowsill, seeing the men lower their weapons as Allen pulls out a bright red device from the dropped backpack and holds it up to them.";
			say "     'Remember that scientist guy telling us these autoinjectors would be easy and nothing can go wrong?' Allen growls, pointing at the fill indicator. 'There's six shots left, and he should have only five!' He presses a button on the side of the syringe and there is a low mechanical sound from it, with a little needle sliding out of the applicator end. 'Yeah, nothing came out right now. It's still at six! Check your own, right now!' All of them hastily scramble to dig out their injectors from the backpacks. While the men are busy, you take a quick glance over to Davies, who currently is in a rather gruesome phase of re-forming his head and face, accompanied by crunching sounds. Quickly looking away and trying to tune that out, you hastily focus on the soldiers instead, who are just calling out, 'I've got five! Me too! Yup, five here too!' Allen nods, sliding his own device back in the pack. 'Okay, looks like we're all fine. Davies is the only one who got a dud!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     The men look startled and nervous, with Carl asking, 'How could this happen?!' Burt shrugs, 'Hell, with how suddenly this whole shit kicked off, I'm not surprised that these things were rushed through production. Not much sense in testing them for weeks and have em ready by the time we're already freaky monsters, I guess.' While the men talked, and you weren't looking too closely at Davies, the transformation of the infected soldier progressed further, now reaching the last stages. Within just a few more moments, he fully becomes a humanoid husky, with three pairs of breasts pushing out of his bared chest and jiggling under his movements. Or rather her movements, as Davies franticly kicks off the uniform pants covering her lower half, which is furry with digitigrade legs, and very much female. The pair of dog tags now resting between the rounded orbs of her breasts are left as the only sign that this was ever anything but a woman.";
			say "     'Can you believe how big those things got, and so fast?' Allen comments with a raised eyebrow, glancing up at the other men who're all watching the husky on the ground now. A paw-hand flies down to her crotch, as if frantically trying to find the cock that has shrunk away to little but the nub of a clit. While doing so, she rubs it with her fingertips and lets out a surprised, aroused groan. This seems to awaken something in the newly created female, drawing her to rub her clit harder, then escalating to slipping two fingers between her nether lips and exploring the opening of her pussy. The other hand quickly joins in, groping over her chest, caressing breasts and pinching nipples as she moans and pants. Carl edges closer leerily, looking down, and exclaims, 'Fuck, fuck, fuck! What are we supposed to do now? Think it'll make a difference if we inject him now?' His squad leader Allen comes up and crouches down next to Davies, bringing his own injector up to her neck and pressing it against the furred flesh. There is a hissing sound as it delivers its contents into the anthro husky's bloodstream.";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Surrounding Davies, the men watch her with bated breath, hoping for... something, which doesn't seem to want to come. The husky just continues to writhe on the ground, fingers buried in her pussy as she pleasures herself with almost mindless focus on her own pleasure. 'Not happening, I guess. But daaammn, look at him go!' Ezra grunts, 'So, uhm... what-' At his point he is interrupted by the sound of someone laughing - an anthro bulldog that you can see at the front end of the alley. 'Knew I smelled something good in here,' the newcomer calls out, baring his teeth aggressively as he sniffs the air. 'One wet and ready bitch and some humans who'll be some too when I'm done!' The muscular brute steps forward, only to freeze in motion as four soldiers raise their weapons in unison, taking aim at him. 'Err, just kidding,' the bulldog grunts, slowly backing away, then vanishing behind the corner when he's far enough back.";
			say "     'What the fuck do we do now? He - err... his scent is getting pretty strong. Even I can smell that, and I'm not some sort of bloodhound furry! Gonna draw any horny infected for a block or two downwind!' Erza muses. Carl raises an eyebrow at the other man and asks, 'What'd you say? What's a furry?' Ezra blushes a bit, just shaking his head and ignoring the question. Having more important things to worry about, Carl quickly moves on to offer, 'We can fight our way back to the blockade. Just gotta keep it together and be ready for em, then...' Allen silences him with a raised hand, 'Not a chance. Look at her - one of us would need to carry the bitch! Also, we got a mission to fulfill! And even if we got her back, drooling and rubbing herself like this, the best Davies can hope for is being prodded by the eggheads for the rest of her life!'";
			WaitLineBreak;
			say "     Scrunching up his features in dismay, Carl exclaims, 'Sir, he's not a bitch! We can't just leave him like this! He's still one of us!' 'Not saying we will, soldier! Here's the new plan: Alpha Team, minus Davies, will continue towards the current objective and check it out, while I take her to one of those abandoned houses we passed a block back. Remember the ones with the light yellow walls? Third in the row. She shouldn't be drawing quite as much attention without her scent being blown all over the place by the wind.' A panted yip of from between the men draws everyone's gaze downwards, where Davies is just having a messy orgasm, femcum squirting and dripping onto the ground. Some semblance of focus comes back to the husky's eyes for a second, with her looking up to meet Allen's gaze. 'C-Can't stop Sarge!' Davies pants in a voice that still has a bit of a male tone to it. Seems like some internal changes haven't quite completed yet.";
			say "     Almost straight away after that, the husky immediately continues to pleasure herself at an almost unabated pace, building towards the next rush of getting off. Shaking his head, Allen looks to each of his men and then continues to say, 'Remember that most of the infected we've encountered weren't mindless. There must be an end of this at some point. She'll wear herself out and calm down, hopefully by the time you return and rendezvous with me at the house. Then we'll proceed together, meet up with Bravo Team and get out of the city, all of us. Everyone understand?' He looks from soldier to soldier, who nod, followed by them helping to pick up Davies and placing her into a one-armed fireman's carry over Allen's shoulder, leaving one hand free to hold his weapon. After that, Carl leads Burt and Ezra onwards, with Allen walking back the way they came, lugging his burden along even as Davies goes on to grind her crotch against his shoulder.";

				say "     You hurry to get to the entrance of the building, stepping outside barely in time to catch a glimpse of where Allen is going. You track the soldier at a long and careful distance for a few minutes, seeing the man threaten several passing people to keep their distance. Finally, he turns off the road to enter a run-down housing complex consisting of a number of buildings. Observing which one he picks, you slowly approach while making sure you're never in full sight of the front door or windows. Instead, you circle around the building and keep close to the wall, ducking under each window and barely peeking over its windowsill to catch a glimpse of the inside. One empty room, two, then you find them: It's a bedroom with a somewhat grimy king-size bed, on which Davies lies outstretched now, still happily rubbing her clit. Glancing a bit to the side, you catch sight of Allen, who's put a chair in one corner of the room and is watching both the husky as well as the door leading into the room. His rifle is leaned against the wall right next to him.";
				say "     The window you're peeking through isn't actually fully shut, instead having about half an inch of an opening through which you can listen to what's going on in there fairly well, and smell the heady musk of canine arousal that must be insanely thick in the room itself. For a long while, most of what you hear are the schlicking sounds of Davies's fingers frigging her pussy and the husky's varied yips and pants as she pushes herself to sate the need the transformation instilled in her. Allen appears to be just silently watching her the whole time, gaze focused on the horny anthro that was one of his subordinate soldiers not so long ago. After the husky comes one more time, adding further to the wet spot on the mattress, she finally seems to calm down, sinking back onto the bed and just panting for breath with her eyes closed. As Allen brushes a hand through is black hair, then gets up to check on her, you notice that the man has a hardon in his pants, clearly outlined under the fabric it is straining against. Seems like having a ringside seat all this time had an impact on him.";

				if calcnumber is 1:
					LineBreak;
					say "     Coming to stand next to the bed, Allen calls out, 'Hey Davies, can you hear me?' Snapping her eyes open, the husky raises herself up on her elbows, looking at him with surprise on her face. 'Sarge! What's -' the transformed soldier starts to say, only to pause and scrunch up her face, trying to stare at her own muzzle with crossed eyes, followed by closing one eye, then the other, and reaching up to touch the muzzle with one paw-hand. 'Oh fuck!' she curses, looking at her own hand and the paw-pads and blunt canine claws on it. 'I - I remember feeling hot, but then, then... god I was almost out of my mind! It felt like I had to, to... be filled. Kinda was burning inside me, and even now, I - it's as if I'm empty inside!' Allen grunts, bending over the bed and letting his gaze travel over the multiple breasts of the husky, then down to her crotch. The man stares at Davies's slick pussy as he says, 'That's because you're a bitch now, a bitch in heat. Just like Laika!' His voice starts out strangely hollow, then becomes almost manic towards the end.";
					say "     Davies looks up in confusion, 'Huh? Who?' Allen glances up for just a second, then goes back to staring at the husky's crotch, 'Oh, she was our family pet when I was a teen. Didn't have her spayed, so she went into heat too. That poor girl suffered and whined for days as we kept her locked up. Finally clawed her way through the lower half of our back door to get out, her need was so strong! But it got all better after I found her in the midst of a pack of neighborhood dogs, fighting over who got to take her next. It's just what a bitch needs, you see. Really a mercy!' Allen seems to be talking more to himself than to Davies, which the husky soldier also notices. 'Sarge, what's going on? Look me in the face!' The next sound you hear from inside the room is a zipper being pulled down, followed by the man pushing his pants and underwear down to his thighs. You catch a glimpse of a firm and muscled ass, pale-skinned and lightly dusted in short, black body hair. 'Wait, what are you doing? No! I'm a guy! You can't -' Davies starts to protest and tries to get up from the bed, only to have Allen pounce on her.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     Grabbing hold of Davies's transformed wrist that is raised in defense, Allen pushes her back down, shrugging off the husky's other arm as it attempts to grab him by the shoulder. 'Stupid Bitch!' Allen shouts at the scared woman before his tone suddenly shifts to a calm and comforting, as if he flipped a switch, 'Shh, be a good girl now. Don't make me punish you. I'm just trying to give you what you need.' Letting out a bark of shock and surprise, Davies replies, 'I'm not a woman, or a fucking dog! Let me go, you maniac!' She struggles desperately against the human, which isn't easy as she's worn out from the repeated orgasms, while he's at full strength and already on top of her. Attempts to kick the man are thwarted after only landing one or two glancing blows that at best leave some bruises, with Allen soon straddling one of Davies's thighs, his knee angled to push her other leg aside. He catches the soldier's other wrist and slams it down onto the mattress, holding Davies through her attempts to writhe out from under him. 'You want it, just admit that! You little slut! You humped against my shoulder the whole way as I carried you here!'";
					say "     During their struggle, the two of them moved around a little, giving you a fairly good viewpoint of what is going on. Allen is pinning his transformed subordinate, knees placed on top of her spread thighs and pressing them down, with his hands gripping her wrists tightly. The man's hard, uncut cock is rubbing against her flat, furry tummy as they move. The struggles of Davies soon weaken, with her being reduced to pleading and begging: 'No, sir! Please! Don't do this to me! I barely found my way back to being able to think again! If you -' Allen lets go of one of her wrists with one hand and gives the husky a punch in the side, seemingly knocking the wind out of her and allowing him to pin both wrists with the other hand. 'Stop making me do this to you, little bitch. Calm down.' Then he reaches down and rubs the sodden fur of Davies's crotch and hones in on her clit. Finding her pleasure-button lightly pinched and stimulated draws an unwilling moan from the bitch, followed by panting as her arousal soars yet again. Slipping three fingers over her sensitive nether lips and spreading them, Allen barks in a commanding tone, 'This is what you need! You wouldn't be so slick and dripping if that wasn't true!'";

						LineBreak;
						say "     Allen takes his time in fingering Davies, rubbing her folds and looking at the wet gash with excited eyes. His middle finger dips into her pussy, feeling the thin barrier of her hymen flex under his touch. 'Be a good girl and I'll give you a treat.' He shifts his hand a little up as he says this, rubbing her clit with circling movements that reduce Davies to trembling in lust and letting out needy whines. While watching this, you move a hand down to your own crotch and start to stroke [if player is herm]your cock, fingers dipping down once or twice to use your own female juices as lube[else if Player is male]your cock with a firm grip, the edge of your thumb caressing its head[else if player is female]your clit, lightly rolling and pinching it between your fingertips[else]yourself[end if] as you get excited from observing the things going on. 'That's better, isn't it.' Allen's face draws into a faint, cold smile, with him then shifting his knees to be between Davies's legs. He grinds his hips down against her, hard cock almost catching the opening of her pussy, but then slipping past the slick opening. 'You're so needy it's almost too slick, see,' the man says in an odd, amused tone, then reaches down to grasp the base of his erection and aiming it at Davies's nether lips, rubbing the head up and down along their middle.";
						say "     'You'll thank me for this, making the cravings stop and taking care of you!' are Allen's last words before he thrusts himself home forcefully, slamming his cock past the husky's hymen in an instant and bottoming out inside of her. Davies bucks under him from the mix of discomfort, her mouth opening in a silent shout. You can't help the spike of arousal that surges through your groin as you watch, [if Player is male]pre-cum leaking from the slit of your shaft[else if player is female]your pussy getting wet and slick[else]a tingly feeling spreading through your groin[end if], and wonder what it'd be like to be right in there with them. 'Damn, that doggie pussy of yours feels amazing around my shaft! Almost as good as Laika! Fuck, this is better than any human snatch!' Allen groans in a lusty voice as he takes her roughly, making deep thrusts in and out. Despite the circumstances, Davies can't help but let out moans and pants as she finds her body reacting to this stimulation. You notice that moment by moment, the voice shifts away from the still somewhat masculine tone it had a moment ago, becoming higher in pitch than before. 'And the view is also pretty nice!' Allen adds right after that, feasting his eyes at how her four breasts shake and bounce each time he slams his hips forward.";
						WaitLineBreak;
						say "     No longer needing to hold Davies down as the former male loses herself in all-encompassing bliss, both of Allen's hands move to cup her breasts. 'Tits for days, well rounded and with soft fur - I love it!' the man grunts amusedly, then lowers his head to the husky's chest and licks one nipple, then another, switching back and forth between them and soon escalating to full on sucking. Davies has her world rocked to the core by him, barely and hour after suddenly starting to transform. Finding herself being dominated like this, pounded by a rock-hard cock and with someone suckling on her breasts to awaken her maternal instincts, you can clearly see in which moment she gives in to her fate: With a needy, animalistic howl, Davies stops being just a passive partner in the sex act you are witnessing, her arms and legs wrapping around Allen and pulling him against her. Seeing the bitch finally accept the role of Allen's fucktoy stokes the fires of your own libido, and you bring a hand up to your own nipples, stroking and pinching them excitedly[if Breast Size of Player > 0] before caressing the curves of your breasts[end if].";
						say "     'Knew you'd *pant* come around. Good girl!' Allen grunts victoriously while still hammering into the husky woman, his breathing choppy and quick now as he approaches his orgasm. 'Gonna breed you good! I'll enjoy seeing puppies grow in you that are [italic type]actually[roman type] mine. Always was such a pity that I had to let someone else knock Laika up!' he almost howls, grinding himself into her sex and reveling in her pussy squeezing around his erection. Before much longer, he reaches climax and bucks into Davies with all the force he can muster, wanting to drive his shaft as deep as it will go.

Their city-camouflage clothing strewn about on the floor and rifles leaning against the opposite wall, you see two soldiers in intimate embrace on a bed. It's a man and a woman, with his hips pumping up and down as he fucks her with fast strokes while she holds him close to her body. One doesn't have to be infected with nanites to feel the basic urges of human existence - and with what's going on in the city and the sexual sights around here especially, those two turned to each other to let off some steam.";

Soon, the woman's moans rise as she gets closer and closer, then turn into full-fledged lustful screams as she orgasms. Her partner isn't far behind, plunging his shaft deep into her pussy and grunting with each shot of semen he cums into her. They lie on the bed in each other's arms for a moment, then the man pulls his cum-dripping cock out of her and stands up, going for a pack of cigarettes lying on a dresser nearby. The woman just lies there, softly stroking her wet pussy lips as she rides out the last bit of her orgasm. Unseen, but deep inside her, her partner's sperm race onwards, doing their duty in the battle to keep humanity going. The fastest of them soon finds a fertile egg, burrowing into it and starts a new life. Only time will tell if its parents succeed in their mission to protect humanity or if it and they will become something different in the end.";

Panting heavily, Lee slips his shrinking shaft from his lover, and rests against the counter beside the mewling Bobbie. His cock, shrinking away, vanishes into his body as a wet gash forms.

Then he starts to fuck, pumping corporal Shaw up and down on his erection while holding the man with his two large hands. Thankfully the groans and pained wincing of the soldier quickly gets replaced by more and more aroused moans, as the guy can't help but get into being fucked by this powerful beast.";

The coupling of man and towering beast turns into more of a mutual affair, filling the street with satisfied groans, grunts and moans. It doesn't take that much longer before corporal Shaw can't hold back anymore and starts blasting out long spurts of cum, splattering his powerful minotaur partner's abs and pecs. The twitching and flexing of the man's rectum around his cock drives Kerry over the edge in short notice too, and with a loud bellow, the minotaur's balls start pumping a massive load into the human's innermost depths.";

Therefore you're not really surprised when grunts, growls and shouts echo out of a nearby alley, drawing your attention. Being the curious person that you are, you do a little sprint over to the opening of said alley and peek inside. The fight going on in the alley is between two anthro hyenas in leather jackets and a male soldier. As you stick your head around the corner, the muscular black guy just punches the first of his attackers right in the muzzle, sending her sprawling on the floor. This enrages the second hyena quite a bit, who throws himself on the soldier, earning him a painful punch to the side but also forcing the human into close-up wrestling to keep the hyena's gnashing teeth from his throat.";
	say "     You find yourself drawn into watching the muscular soldier struggle with his opponent - lots of punching, squeezing, scratching, biting, and even some groping from the hyena. This guy is clearly no novice to fighting and uses ALL weapons available to him - including the fact that the nanites override people's will to resist if they get horny enough. The conclusion of their fight is uncertain for a while - but eventually the soldier starts to get the upper hand as he manages to catch the canine's closed maw in grip. With the threat of being bitten momentarily removed, the human uses his handhold to twist back his enemy's head, then slams a shoulder into the anthro's chest to bull-rush him into the nearest wall. With a hollow thunk, the hyena's head impacts the bricks, after which his human opponent lets go, allowing the canine to crumple bonelessly to the floor. He is still alive, from what you can see - with the nanites, most wounds heal sooner or later after all - but surely out for the count.";

Panting for breath, the soldier looks at the pile of hyenas and walks a few steps away, rapidly regaining his composure. 'You really saved my bacon,' he calls over to you and gives a thankful smile.

Camo pattern pants, army boots and an olive colored backpack are the only other pieces of equipment on him, with all of them somewhat ripped and torn.

Just ATE it, lock, stock, and barrel! But yeah - it wasn't that useful in that situation anyway - you can't just shoot everyone just because they're being driven crazy by this nanite shit!'

'Um - I know it's a bit of an odd request for someone you just met, but... could you check me out? I wanna know what's going on. Just give it to me straight!' With that, the man turns his back to you, holding up his shirt a little. You tell him what you see - a muscular back with smooth, sweaty black skin... and a few hairs of what looks like hyena fur sticking up above the waistband of his pants.

He is pursued by [one of]a pyrenean mountain dog[or]a black bear[or]a timber wolf[or]a tiger[or]a hulk of a man[or]a dragon[or]a badger[or]a minotaur[or]a gorilla[or]a hyena[or]a rhino[or]an alligator[at random] who tackles him into a dip in the ground just before a hail of bullets impacts against the earth above them. While you can't hear them, you see the larger anthro place a hand on the other's shoulder reassuringly before giving him a hug. They crawl out of the pit cautiously, back towards their fellow refugees. Now that they are moving away from the cordon, the soldiers watch them warily, but refrain from shooting. The ragged group stagger back into the city, huddled together and relieved at such a close brush with tragedy. Not wishing to cross the open area yourself, you too return to the relative safety of the city.";

Please present yourself at the entrance of the checkpoint.' The announcement has not even ended that packs of transformed survivors rush from their hiding spots towards the flattened no-man's land, towards one of the few buildings still left intact, for the military to occupy. Two squads of soliders stands watch in front of the habitation, ensuring that no one would trespass. On the other side, you see a truck parking under good escort.";

Hazmat-suit wearing workers get off the truck, carrying crates. The infected become agitated while the workers open the crates. They throw packs of food and clean water to the crowd, which goes into a frenzy over the limited supplies. Small scuffles break out in the large group, while the soldiers watch impassively on their side. You spot, safely hidden behind the windows of the bulding's upper floor, persons in labcoats, who seem observe the event from a safe distance, probably taking notes.";
					say "     Eventually, the distribution is over. The crowd clears, most people having managed to get some supplies, while others are walking away empty-handed and dejected. The speakers announce the time and day for the next distribution, leaving the survivors to fend for themselves in the meantime, and you among them.";

You suddenly notice something unusual on your side: a [one of]rat[or]husky[or]fox[or]orc[or]gorilla[or]catboy[or]fennec[or]bear[at random] slips carefully from flattened building to broken walls of concrete, eventually posting himself into a destroyed store, of which only a corner wall remains. He flashes a light towards the soldiers, who head in his direction.";

After a moment spent haggling, the infected hands over a lumpy plastic bag in exchange. One of the soldiers takes it with care not to touch the person's hand, then pulls a bundle of bank notes from it to look at and nods. After some more discussions, the two groups part ways. The solider resume their patrol, as if nothing had happened, while the would-be black-market supplier goes back to where he came from, a stack of rations held in his arms.";
