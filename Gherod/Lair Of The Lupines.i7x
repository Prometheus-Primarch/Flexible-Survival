He is also of average height, but his body looks especially fit from his waist down, namely his glutes and thighs, giving him a slightly different figure than most werewolves you can encounter in here. He also wears a loincloth, the standard underwear these werewolves wear, if any at all, and bulging somewhat less than the others. Attitude-wise, he often is focused on his own doings or thoughts and avoids eye contact with everyone.";

We met after he started dating a friend of mine, when she introduced us, by the time their relationship was serious. When we went to college, things got weird.

When I tried to tell him I felt... differently towards him, he just shrugged it off. The next night I found him humping my ass in my bed, saying he wouldn't mind a sex bud.

Your captor says this while mischievously grinning, and after some prolonged eye contact as he pets your head like if you were, indeed, a pup, he begins to walk away as he gestures to other werewolves to gather around you.

They do not even address you as anything in particular, just using you as a fucktoy and filling you up with more loads until you cannot even walk. Your entire body feels so swollen that you can only roll around at some point, spread your legs for the next werewolf to fuck you silly while you choke on some other's cock, all while being utterly covered in lupine jizz, smelling like beast fluids and sweat. This mess drags on for what feels like the whole night...";

He says nothing as he makes eye contact with you, only coming down to grab you and jump back out with the agility of a feline, as strange as that may sound. With the dim light of the pit's torches, you are [bold type]able to recognize him as Kirnon[roman type], but he urges you to say nothing as he carries you to a more private area. This space is nothing more than a small storage room connecting to the pit, that barely anyone uses. He pushes the door open, puts you on the other side, enters and closes it back, locking it with a key he had tucked in the band of his loincloth.";
	say "     'Rules are, if you're down there, you're a slave and gotta do what you're told, no questions.' You nod, as even an average-sized werewolf brute can still be quite intimidating when serious, plus you are not exactly in a favorable condition. 'Good. What happens here stays between us. Got it?' And, once again, you nod without a word. Once he fully realizes you understand all the terms of this exchange, he drops his guard a little and proceeds to slide his loincloth down. The reason his bulge was not so big when compared to the others comes to full exposure, as Kirnon's cock might be the smallest you have ever seen in a werewolf, at least soft. Regardless of comparative size, it is still a quite admirable one, and you would seldom see a human carrying one like that.";

	say "     The sight of the naked and muscular silver werewolf is something to cherish, however. What Kirnon lacks in size, he has in definition and shape, but what really catches your eyes is how thick his legs are. It gives you an idea of how large his glutes must be, that is, before he starts turning around, seeing that you've got your eyes on him. You were right, that fuzzy ass proved to be up to your expectations as a pair of marvelous and volumous furred buttocks are presented before you, with the nice bonus of his full balls hanging underneath. Kirnon only has to make sure his fluffy tail does not get in the way, and you get a clear view at his butthole once he begins to spread his asscheeks.";
	say "     He glances over his shoulder and back at you, then gives you an order, 'Get your face in there and eat me out.' His hole only blinks desperately at the anticipation, looking so eager that you would almost feel bad for refusing to give it attention. Rules are rules, however, and you must follow them even if you, by any chance, had any idea of refusing his command. Leaning your head over the werewolf's plump buttcheeks, you place your hands over his glutes and proceed to press your lips against that yearning pucker, giving it a kiss, then a tentative lick, only to cause the silver lupine to moan, 'Fuck...' He keeps good hold of himself, at least for now, as your tongue continues to wiggle against such a sensitive spot.";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     You can even feel his anal muscles relax and let you push more of your tongue in it, licking it so good that Kirnon starts clawing at the door, grinding his ass against your face and grunting in pleasure. He is not that tight either, which suggests that he does enjoy anal play a lot more than he seems to show. 'You're... doing well...' he says to you, amidst a moan that he tries so hard to not be loud about, and knowing that you really are having an effect on him, you give him a little bit more tongue further inside his butthole while your hands move to grab his asscheeks, completely indulging in the rimming action. Some jerking movements follow soon after you do that, and you realize the werewolf is stroking his own erection due to his excitement.";

He now mindlessly moans, lowly, enjoying every single bit of pleasure you are providing him. With enough time, you think the werewolf comes close to the point of no return and begins to edge, thoroughly enjoying your rimjob. 'Fuck, I can't hold it any longer... Don't stop... Please...' he practically begs, and you dare not deny his request.";

'Aah... Fuck... You did so good...' he says, complimenting your efforts as you give his ass a couple of final licks before the beast allows you to stand before him. 'You... You keep your mouth shut about this. You hear me?' You only nod in response. 'You better. I... I may... pick you up to do this again. You know where to be.'";

He then stops what he is doing and leads you over to a counter in the deepest corner of the kitchen, and you get the feeling you are about to prepare some food with him. However, he only turns to you and begins to talk. 'There is one type of cake that Jett never refuses when presented. I must dare say, it is the only one he cannot resist. Would you please close the door as I make preparations?'";

You do so discretely, as to not alert anyone else outside, just in case. The door is a bit heavy, though, so it takes you a while until you manage to fully close it. It now feels a bit stuck, but you should be able to open it back if you were not trying to be so careful, or just ask Rodion. He is a strong and burly guy, surely a heavy door would be no match for him. Speaking of him, he does not seem to be making a sound. You hear no cabinets nor any movement for a while, but anyway, you are done closing it, now it is time to turn back and...'";

The burly werewolf brute has one of his legs on top of the counter with his bare and massive furry ass pointed towards you, all spread out and exposing his soft butthole. His fuzzy tail wags happily as he looks at you, holding his head with one hand on the counter as he beckons you to come. 'Thought I'd give you a personal demonstration. Don't be shy! It's alright to come closer...' You are not so sure this is the type of [']cake['] you were expecting, but since the opportunity presents itself...

You can only notice how huge his ass is when you finally get closer, so plump and massive, with each buttcheek popping out like fat bubbles. It is so round and soft, with the consistency of a powerful sizable ass and a perfect blend of muscle and fat. 'This is his favorite. Oh, and don't mind the size of mine, he doesn't discriminate. What counts is the intention, your willingness to provide him with something personal, putting yourself vulnerable for him... And giving him a tasty snack in the process.' You remain there, observing Rodion attentively as he speaks, your eyes following his buttcheeks bouncing up and down as he moves his ass teasingly.";
				say "     With one hand, he grabs one of his asscheeks and spreads it further to the side, giving you an even clearer view of his hole. It looks very soft and receptive, and it even winks at you. 'He likes a good show too, so make sure you put on a really nice one. For the ladies, or if you just happen to have a pussy on you, just let him see how moist and juicy it is, as he will prefer to go for it. But for those without one, just show him he can own your ass and eat it for as long as he pleases. He has got such a long and nice tongue too, great reach... I got so excited I couldn't stop grinding my butt on his muzzle, wanting more of that skillful tongue in me...' As he continues speaking, his hole begins to throb in need...";

This, as a sign that you intend to approach him, makes the werewolf moan softly, and he makes no move to stop you either. Following your initial intention, you lean over your head between his buns, right on that warm area, putting your tongue out to press against his winking hole. Its softness shows how receptive his ass is, and he seems to have great control over it, enough to relax his anal muscles and allow your tongue to dig deeper inside. As you wiggle it, Rodion only moans in pleasure, mindlessly pressing his ass back against your face, as if beckoning you to continue.";
					say "     Having received such a positive feedback, you carry on eating the burly wolfman's ass out, now fully committed to accept his offering, and place both hands on his buttcheeks. With your head properly tucked in between them, you provide Rodion a full experience of ass worship and rimming that just sets his cravings skyrocketing. His breathing gets immediately more intense as pleasure begins to overtake him, that sensitive pucker of his yearning more and more for your attention, and you do not let him down. By digging your tongue so deep inside him, licking at the inner walls of his butthole and pushing even further ahead, you manage to drive the cook insane with lust. He cannot help but jerk himself off, causing his hole to throb around your tongue as his prostate pulsates.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     It does not take you a lot to realize this might be one of Rodion's favorite things, getting his ass eaten out so voraciously, and you make sure you do not disappoint. 'Fuck...' an almost whispering word escapes his lips amidst a moan, the werewolf barely able to hold himself against such an experience, one which you can clearly see that turns him on beyond anything. You really put on a lot of effort into devouring his ass by pressing your whole face against it, squashing your lips on that hole and pushing your tongue in, wiggling and flicking it around. Thanks to the immensely positive reception Rodion shows before your commitment, confidence prevails in you, causing you to feel like the best ass licker in town.";
					say "     This is set to last for a considerable amount of time, as you follow up with lots of licking and butt massaging, causing Rodion to further lean himself over the counter so you can have even better access to his rear. His fluffy tail wags around excitedly at the pleasure he is receiving, though a fair bit above you so it does not brush against you constantly. He completely loses himself in the nearly a lusty stupor as he continues to stroke his own cock. 'Feels so fucking good... Ooh... P-please, don't stop...' he begs, and your gestures imply that you will not even consider stopping while that tasty grand ass is practically hugging your face. Instead, you lift his buttocks and get more of your mouth pushed against his soft hole.";
					WaitLineBreak;
					say "     The whole thing starts looking like you just have the cook's ass laying on top of your face, both of his legs having found their way up the counter as Rodion holds himself onto the wall at the end of it. He also wiggles and grinds his ass against your face, much alike how he said he did to Jett, although you think the big alpha had a much easier time managing this whole situation. With such enthusiasm, if he was actually sitting on your face, you would probably be in trouble, completely overwhelmed by his sheer size, strength and weight. But the circumstances, right now, actually help you, giving you the simple freedom of movement to continue eating his ass, getting a good taste of how his enormous buttcheeks would feel around your face.";
					say "     'Fuck, I'm... Getting close... Pleeease, don't stop now...!' He picks up the pace then, and you fully bury your tongue inside his ass, to the very last inch you can push, and begin to wiggle and lick at his insides with as much enthusiasm as you can muster. This proves to be very effective as Rodion's moans increase in both frequency and volume, his ass now seriously grinding against your face, and then, his pucker begins to throb as he warns 'I'm cumming, fuck... Yes!' You dare not to slow down, not even one bit, as your tongue continues to wiggle as fast as you can make it, and you feel his orgasm with each throb of his anal ring. Rodion shoots his load all the way while your face is still filling the space between his buttocks.";

Rodion then slowly gets off the counter and looks at the mess he has made, a little embarrassed of the whole situation. 'I should probably clean this up before it dries, or... someone sees this! Doing this in the kitchen, of all places, I'm...' he stops talking, grabs a cloth and begins to clean up the cum, which now you get to see, and it was actually a lot. The cook keeps making sure there is no drop left on his counter, almost in an obsessive manner. You approach him and ask if he is alright, as he seems quite distressed...";
					say "     'O-oh? I am, yes! I... I just don't know what came over me! I have no idea why I did that, I suppose I must've been-...' You then stop him and let him know that you actually enjoyed this, or you would not have taken the step to pleasure him like you did. He looks back at you and smiles after a while, seemingly calming himself down. 'Okay, maybe... Maybe I needed that. I'm glad you didn't think of it as inappropriate, even though it probably was... You know, most werewolves here are expected to be tops and I... I prefer the other way around. It messes me up when I don't manage to keep hold of myself... But thank you! You're really nice! We could probably do this again sometime... I-if you want.'";

If you do this, then let me know how it goes! I'm sure he'll like it a lot!' Now that the quite hands-on demonstration of what to offer Jett is done, you have absolute certainty of what kind of [']cake['] Rodion meant. Perhaps [bold type]you could try this plan with the alpha werewolf to make him like you more[roman type], but you feel like [bold type]you have actually bonded with the burly werewolf cook[roman type] a little as well[roman type].

But indeed, it should be everything you need to impress Jett, if you so wish. He loves eating a nice and big cake, yeah!' It seems that, translating what he just said, Jett appreciates a good amount of supple ass. In all honesty, it does not surprise you.";
