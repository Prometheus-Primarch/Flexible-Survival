The Alpha does not wear anything to cover his hanging junk, which looks almost hyper-sized, even for someone of his stature. You also do not think anything would be able to cover that much cock and that pair of ostrich-egg sized balls, as even his furred sheath can barely contain all the meat within.

He is also of average height, but his body looks especially fit from his waist down, namely his glutes and thighs, giving him a slightly different figure than most werewolves you can encounter in here. He also wears a loincloth, the standard underwear these werewolves wear, if any at all, and bulging somewhat less than the others. Attitude-wise, he often is focused on his own doings or thoughts and avoids eye contact with everyone.";

You were right, that fuzzy ass proved to be up to your expectations as a pair of marvelous and volumous furred buttocks are presented before you, with the nice bonus of his full balls hanging underneath.

Rules are rules, however, and you must follow them even if you, by any chance, had any idea of refusing his command. Leaning your head over the werewolf's plump buttcheeks, you place your hands over his glutes and proceed to press your lips against that yearning pucker, giving it a kiss, then a tentative lick, only to cause the silver lupine to moan, 'Fuck...'

'You're... doing well...' he says to you, amidst a moan that he tries so hard to not be loud about, and knowing that you really are having an effect on him, you give him a little bit more tongue further inside his butthole while your hands move to grab his asscheeks, completely indulging in the rimming action.

He now mindlessly moans, lowly, enjoying every single bit of pleasure you are providing him. With enough time, you think the werewolf comes close to the point of no return and begins to edge, thoroughly enjoying your rimjob. 'Fuck, I can't hold it any longer... Don't stop...

'Aah... Fuck... You did so good...' he says, complimenting your efforts as you give his ass a couple of final licks before the beast allows you to stand before him. 'You... You keep your mouth shut about this. You hear me?' You only nod in response. 'You better. I... I may... pick you up to do this again. You know where to be.'";

Quickly, you start glancing around for a place to hide, but when you can finally react, it is too late. A strong, masculine and rough voice speaks to you, coming from the biggest werewolf brute you have ever seen, standing right in front of you and keeping you from leaving. 'Now, now... where do you think you're going?' he asks, crossing is very muscular arms in front of his chest and looking down on you with a grin on his lupine muzzle, wagging his fluffy tail slowly behind his monstrous legs.

You try to shake that feeling away as your heart races faster, excitement fueling your body from every angle and inch, tempting you to drop your chance at escaping this place, and from the looks of the huge werewolf brute in front of you, he knows exactly what effect he is having on you. 'And here I was thinking my comrades['] hospitality was so unmatched nobody ain't leaving our humble abode... I guess not everyone shares this sentiment.' You instantly feel apologetic, even without any real reason to be, but suddenly, you feel unworthy of his generosity.

Usually, however, any slaves they capture stay in the oubliette until they're left with nothing in their brains. In all honesty, it bores them, that's why they keep bringing in new people. Now, you don't really have to stay, although you haven't started begging for my dick just yet. You've got more resolve than most, heheh...'";

As your eyes laid on it for quite some time, he chuckled as he noticed you staring directly at his crotch. 'If you do stay, however, I'll let you play with it. If you manage to not turn into a brainless little slut afterwards, I'll even adopt you as my personal servant. If you do lose your mind, though, it's just sex slave for you. I imagine you wouldn't mind either...' His grin widens, but he then returns to a more serious tone, once more crossing his arms and no longer teasing you for entertainment.";

I'm sure you can tell I can rip anyone in half with these...' he then flexes both his arms, biceps as massive as your whole head, maybe even a little bigger than that. 'Can always squeeze them between my quads if my arms won't do the job, heheh... In short, Jett will be your best friend if you behave and follow the rules, but if you double-cross him... You're in for a lot of pain. So, remember that, and you'll be fine.'";

You gotta be naked[roman type]. No arguing there. My boys all hang out with nothing covering their sexy bodies, so you should follow their example. No smuggling weird shit either, and no picking fights with any of my lads. If you wanna fight someone, you'll fight me, and you won't like it. Got that too?' You nod again, to his pleasure. 'Good.

Something about this makes you feel dirty, but of a good kind, and your heart skips a beat due to the rush of the anticipation. Once he sees you are still hesitating, only having considered in silence what you shall be doing next, he tilts his fuzzy head and leans forward slightly, 'Is there any problem? All of a sudden you look anxious for something...' Jett keeps his eyes on you as you think of a reply, on top of everything else, and you figure the best solution is to tell him all about it.";
		say "     'Oh, I see... So you've befriended Rodion? That's good to know, I'm pleased that you've been getting along with my crew. And it even seems he's revealed you a way to personally gift me. I've to say I'm flattered you went into such trouble just to find something I liked... Does that mean you intend to make an offer as well?' His smile is nicer than you would expect, and you do not feel so intimidated now. You really just want him to like you, and if that is the way you must do it, then why not give it a shot? You nod to his question, replying positively, and he chuckles amusedly. 'Oh, I see... Now I truly am flattered. Well, then do me a favor, if you will.' You nod once more, displaying your availability to receive his request.";

Back when you arrived, it was merely one of my grunts who caught you snooping outside, so I didn't really pay much attention, though we've had... problems before, with undesired guests, so my vigilance has been even greater ever since. This to say... I would love to accept your gift, but I must find a replacement for my current post, just for a while...' His eyes look over you as he leans back to his couch, a hint of a smirk beginning to show on his muzzle, and you begin to fear what this request is, for some reason.";

Then, return to me and I shall make preparations for our private session.' To this request, your eyes widen. He is sending you on a short distanced quest to deliver a message, and not to just anyone. To Elstan, of all the werewolves in here, who has the fame of being quite a rival to Jett. You struggle to comprehend the meaning of this request, but it seems he is leaving you no other choice if you want to proceed further. 'I shall be waiting for you. Hope you get to show me how much of a good and efficient [boygirl] you are. That'd be pleasant to see...'";

Elstan then accepted your reasoning and was convinced to do this favor for Jett. 'A silver-tongued diplomat, aren't you? I wouldn't expect you to be able to use words to persuade that brat. In fact, I'm very pleased to hear you've managed to choose this path and be successful. It... also brings me some additional information about this guy. Perhaps I can keep him tame if I show more appreciation for his efforts... which I admit, it's a fact I often overlook.'";
		else if Resolution of JettDominance is 4:

He laughs, amused by your choice of tactics. 'My, that is definitely a good one! Bother him until he does what he's told! It seldom fails on him. Although, try not to get on bad terms. I'm not looking to have an enemy within these walls. In fact, I do care about Elstan. He's simply impossible to deal with, that's the problem, but anyway. Maybe not all hope is lost...'";
		else if Resolution of JettDominance is 5:
			say "     You do try to tell him how you have managed to do it, but you cannot help but feel embarrassed about your tactic of choice. As you explain everything that happened, Jett's expression changes to a worrisome one. 'Oh, boy... You didn't have to put yourself in such position. Elstan's just a pushover, he likes to bark but he doesn't actually get anything done. Might I suggest next time to simply bore him until he accepts the task at hand? In last case, you just return to me and I'll advise you properly.' He beckons you to approach him, and so you do, only to be surprised by a gentle stroke over your face. 'Just remember you're a very strong person. You've managed to endure this apocalypse with your mind intact, and you're still kicking. You can face a lot more shit than the average person around here, and you don't have to do anything you don't really want to. So feel free to keep up that cute smile of yours, it'd be a shame if you lost it!'";

		WaitLineBreak;

'Now that congratulations are in order, let's get to what brought you here in the first place... I'm pretty sure Elstan will be here any moment, so we can start going to my personal chambers.' He beckons you to walk in front of him as he directs your way through a discrete pathway parting from the main hub into a corridor, then into a door, which he unlocks. Then, you are led to what seems like a hallway of an apartment, to your surprise. It is even resized to Jett's impressive height and size, so everything seems quite big compared to an average person.";
		say "     The werewolf then closes the door behind you, and you hear a lock kicking in. 'To keep undesired guests from entering,' he says, and gestures you to walk forward, then turn right, as to dismiss any worries you may have. He follows you closely as you arrive at a bedroom with a massive bed, which is in fact almost the entire room. There are pillows and... quite not what you would expect from an [']alpha brute['], as the decoration of choice, despite the rocky walls, feels very cozy and colorful. He even has a plushie of a cute little green blob monster, and you are quick to ask about it, as it just is too unexpected. He laughs it out as beckons you to take a seat atop his bed's sheets, which are extremely comfortable.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Yes, I admit my personal chambers may look as something quite unexpected to people who haven't known me in a while...' he jokingly says, but you notice his expression changing when looking back at the plushie. 'That was a gift from my parents back when I was a small kid, and it was one of my favorite toys. Obviously we... eventually disconnect from such stuff as we lose interest in children's plays and whatnot, so this one was among many others back at my parents' house. So... Well, I've had lost contact with them for a while, but they used to live in the area. When this whole shit started, I've decided to visit the place, and... Found this little guy, still undamaged, among the debris. No trace of my parents, however. Which is probably a good thing.'";
		say "     You ask him if he thinks they might have succumbed to the nanites, and he shrugs. 'They might have, they might not. Whatever the case, we didn't leave in good terms. But that little plushie over there gave me memories... Happy childhood memories. It's such a shame we can't go back and make it all be fine, right?' Well, this you were not expecting. Jett definitely seems to be more than meets the eye, and him opening up to you like this just reminds you that he is still a person, and not just the leader of the werewolf brutes pack, much less an animalistic brute. Eventually, you reach out for his shoulder in an instinct, as in hopes to comfort him. 'Huh, this is not what we came here for, is it? I'm sure you had something else more fun in mind... And I've probably ruined the mood, huh.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Perhaps the mood does not need to be ruined, so you let him know that you are happy he invited you here. He shows you a genuine smile as he gently places one of his massive furred arms over your shoulders. 'Well, I have an idea of what Rodion told you. Did he show you his [']cake[']?' You nod, as that was exactly what happened. 'Yeah, I do love eating someone out. Though not just anyone, mind you. I'm mostly turned on by the pleasure I can give to someone, and let's say our cook really likes ass play.' He looks at you in brief silence as he has you lean onto him, his soft fur tickling your body before you find yourself sinking into his coat. Jett feels really warm, and on top of that, he truly is massive.";
		say "     'Mind if we just cuddle? To be honest, I'm enjoying this...'";
		say "     You see no reason to refuse his request, since you went through all this trouble already. Besides, he feels very nice against your naked body, more even as you lie down together. He holds you like a teddy bear, really close to him, though mindful of his strength to not completely smother you. As you both are bare, you feel each other's presences to their fullest. The both of you share no additional words, only enjoying the peace and quiet of the place in a very comfortable and large bed, with the company of one another. It is a relaxing time, so much that you eventually doze off along with the alpha werewolf brute, feeling safe and good.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Time passes, and you wake up still next to him. You both have not moved even an inch away from each other, but you catch a glimpse of Jett sleeping like a baby while holding you close. It is probably time to wake him up from the nap, as Elstan is likely to get grumpy for waiting too long, so you poke him until he opens his eyes. 'Huh... Oh, we... slept? That's... odd.' He begins to get up, and you immediately miss his warm presence next to you. 'Have I missed being with a sane person for this long...? I barely recognize myself, sometimes.' Jett looks back at you and speaks in a seemingly apologetic manner, 'I've probably made you waste your time... But if it counts for anything, I'm glad for this moment. It was definitely an enjoyable gift.'";
		say "     As it seems you have accomplished your objective anyway, you tell him everything is fine, as long as Jett appreciated it. 'Not quite what you had in mind, I take it... Rodion wasn't too far off what I truly like receiving. I've had good moments with him as well, but each person is different. I'm hoping we can have a different kind of fun in the future, you and me. And that I promise it won't be just cuddling...' the werewolf chuckles.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Finally, you two start leaving Jett's private quarters and back onto the lair's main hub. Elstan fulfilled his word and is taking his gatekeeper duty seriously, while also sitting on Jett's couch. He does not see this as an insult, much the contrary. The alpha is quite amused at how Elstan looks in the leader's spot. 'Enjoying your few moments of glory?' he teases, to which the young muscular werewolf grunts. 'Are you done fucking? Nobody's been here other than a few others carrying slaves leaking cum off their holes. You know, as if we didn't have enough lying there in the pits being useless.' The alpha beckons him to get up, but looks at him in the eye as he speaks. 'Those are the same ones that keep running away and coming back, so you don't have to worry. Besides, if you care about the lair so much, try paying more attention to what's happening around you instead of your own muscles. Which, by the way...' he taps Elstan's hip in a brief pause, 'Yeah, you're taking really good care of yourself...'";
		say "     Elstan stares back at Jett, confused by his last compliment, which just came after a taunting commentary about his lack of attention. He does not seem to be able to process that. 'Uh... What do you... Thanks, I guess?' The alpha chuckles, then properly thanks Elstan for the favor. 'I appreciate you taking your time to help me out. You're dismissed.' The large werewolf then takes back his seat as he gestures Elstan to leave, if he wants to. You nod back at him, and as you have shared a moment of intimacy, you believe [bold type]you have formed a bond with Jett.[roman type][line break]";

He then stops what he is doing and leads you over to a counter in the deepest corner of the kitchen, and you get the feeling you are about to prepare some food with him.

You do so discretely, as to not alert anyone else outside, just in case. The door is a bit heavy, though, so it takes you a while until you manage to fully close it. It now feels a bit stuck, but you should be able to open it back if you were not trying to be so careful, or just ask Rodion.

His fuzzy tail wags happily as he looks at you, holding his head with one hand on the counter as he beckons you to come. 'Thought I'd give you a personal demonstration. Don't be shy! It's alright to come closer...' You are not so sure this is the type of [']cake['] you were expecting, but since the opportunity presents itself...

What counts is the intention, your willingness to provide him with something personal, putting yourself vulnerable for him... And giving him a tasty snack in the process.'

For the ladies, or if you just happen to have a pussy on you, just let him see how moist and juicy it is, as he will prefer to go for it. But for those without one, just show him he can own your ass and eat it for as long as he pleases. He has got such a long and nice tongue too, great reach...

Following your initial intention, you lean over your head between his buns, right on that warm area, putting your tongue out to press against his winking hole. Its softness shows how receptive his ass is, and he seems to have great control over it, enough to relax his anal muscles and allow your tongue to dig deeper inside. As you wiggle it, Rodion only moans in pleasure, mindlessly pressing his ass back against your face, as if beckoning you to continue.";

His breathing gets immediately more intense as pleasure begins to overtake him, that sensitive pucker of his yearning more and more for your attention, and you do not let him down. By digging your tongue so deep inside him, licking at the inner walls of his butthole and pushing even further ahead, you manage to drive the cook insane with lust. He cannot help but jerk himself off, causing his hole to throb around your tongue as his prostate pulsates.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     It does not take you a lot to realize this might be one of Rodion's favorite things, getting his ass eaten out so voraciously, and you make sure you do not disappoint. 'Fuck...' an almost whispering word escapes his lips amidst a moan, the werewolf barely able to hold himself against such an experience, one which you can clearly see that turns him on beyond anything. You really put on a lot of effort into devouring his ass by pressing your whole face against it, squashing your lips on that hole and pushing your tongue in, wiggling and flicking it around. Thanks to the immensely positive reception Rodion shows before your commitment, confidence prevails in you, causing you to feel like the best ass licker in town.";
				say "     This is set to last for a considerable amount of time, as you follow up with lots of licking and butt massaging, causing Rodion to further lean himself over the counter so you can have even better access to his rear. His fluffy tail wags around excitedly at the pleasure he is receiving, though a fair bit above you so it does not brush against you constantly. He completely loses himself in the nearly a lusty stupor as he continues to stroke his own cock. 'Feels so fucking good... Ooh... P-please, don't stop...' he begs, and your gestures imply that you will not even consider stopping while that tasty grand ass is practically hugging your face. Instead, you lift his buttocks and get more of your mouth pushed against his soft hole.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     The whole thing starts looking like you just have the cook's ass laying on top of your face, both of his legs having found their way up the counter as Rodion holds himself onto the wall at the end of it. He also wiggles and grinds his ass against your face, much alike how he said he did to Jett, although you think the big alpha had a much easier time managing this whole situation. With such enthusiasm, if he was actually sitting on your face, you would probably be in trouble, completely overwhelmed by his sheer size, strength and weight. But the circumstances, right now, actually help you, giving you the simple freedom of movement to continue eating his ass, getting a good taste of how his enormous buttcheeks would feel around your face.";
				say "     'Fuck, I'm... Getting close... Pleeease, don't stop now...!' He picks up the pace then, and you fully bury your tongue inside his ass, to the very last inch you can push, and begin to wiggle and lick at his insides with as much enthusiasm as you can muster. This proves to be very effective as Rodion's moans increase in both frequency and volume, his ass now seriously grinding against your face, and then, his pucker begins to throb as he warns 'I'm cumming, fuck... Yes!' You dare not to slow down, not even one bit, as your tongue continues to wiggle as fast as you can make it, and you feel his orgasm with each throb of his anal ring. Rodion shoots his load all the way while your face is still filling the space between his buttocks.";
				WaitLineBreak;
				say "     He pants as the last drops leak from his dick, you finally pulling away and standing up to face the burly werewolf. 'Phew, that... That was really hot! Fuck, you're good at this...' Rodion then slowly gets off the counter and looks at the mess he has made, a little embarrassed of the whole situation. 'I should probably clean this up before it dries, or... someone sees this! Doing this in the kitchen, of all places, I'm...' he stops talking, grabs a cloth and begins to clean up the cum, which now you get to see, and it was actually a lot. The cook keeps making sure there is no drop left on his counter, almost in an obsessive manner. You approach him and ask if he is alright, as he seems quite distressed...";
				say "     'O-oh? I am, yes! I... I just don't know what came over me! I have no idea why I did that, I suppose I must've been-...' You then stop him and let him know that you actually enjoyed this, or you would not have taken the step to pleasure him like you did. He looks back at you and smiles after a while, seemingly calming himself down. 'Okay, maybe... Maybe I needed that. I'm glad you didn't think of it as inappropriate, even though it probably was... You know, most werewolves here are expected to be tops and I... I prefer the other way around. It messes me up when I don't manage to keep hold of myself... But thank you! You're really nice! We could probably do this again sometime... I-if you want.'";

If you do this, then let me know how it goes! I'm sure he'll like it a lot!' Now that the quite hands-on demonstration of what to offer Jett is done, you have absolute certainty of what kind of [']cake['] Rodion meant.

Yeah, that's pretty much it!' he says, getting out of the counter and recomposing himself. 'Uhm... I got a little carried away there, I'll admit! But indeed, it should be everything you need to impress Jett, if you so wish. He loves eating a nice and big cake, yeah!' It seems that, translating what he just said, Jett appreciates a good amount of supple ass. In all honesty, it does not surprise you.";

This is sort of embarrassing, really! I thought you'd like a personal demonstration on how to give Jett what he really likes, but... I, well, t-this is pretty much it, really. He loves eating a nice cake, yeah!'
