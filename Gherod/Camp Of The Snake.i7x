to say CampOfTheSnakeDesc:
	say "     This large encampment is where the bioluminescent lizard brutes make their homes, located in a dim clearing in the middle of the damp swamp of Avalon. You can tell they are a quite prosper tribe by the looks of some of their garments, jewelry, the amount of supplies they have stored in assigned spots for such things, and of course, the large and even grandiose tents where most of these reptilians live. The most prominent feature of this place is, however, the enormous temple located [bold type]north[roman type] of here, with the head of a large snake looming over these grounds. From here, you can also see Sevik's tent just [bold type]northeast[roman type] of your current position.";

instead of smelling Camp Of The Snake:
	say "     You can sense various scents in the air, from flowery perfume to incenses closer to the tents. Occasionally, there is an appealing smell of food, too, usually grilled fish.";

to say TempleOfTheSnakeEntranceDesc:
	say "     You are now at the entrance of this enormous temple, the large snake head atop the open gates looming over you almost menacingly, though kind of beautifully so, in a way. The temple itself is a large structure of mostly beige and golden colors, built in an extravagant way that leads further ahead and slightly downwards, and is likely the main attraction of this encampment with such fascinating architecture. You can tell by its evident mysticism that this seems to be an otherworldly structure hiding secrets. Heading [bold type]inside[roman type] will lead you to the throne room where Uzial spends most of his day taking on audiences for his people or whatever else he does. Alternatively, you could always pay a visit to Sevik at his tent if you head [bold type]east[roman type] instead.";

to say TempleOfTheSnakeThroneRoomDesc:
	say "     This dim room stands after another set of large gates and a wide corridor which leads you slightly downwards, potentially underground, where the only light comes from a few sets of torches scattered through the side walls and corners of this enormous room. Most of the floor is paved in stone In the middle is the throne, design with grandiosity in mind as it is where Uzial sits most of his time doing tribe god leader things, and the giant himself almost also makes part of the throne room's decoration. Heading [bold type]outside[roman type] would, obviously, lead you back to the entrance facing the encampment.";

instead of smelling Temple Of The Snake Throne Room:
	say "     This particular room smells slightly of incense, though due to the size of it you can easily justify why it is so faint.";

to say SevikTentDesc:
	say "     This might be the most luxurious tent of them all, did it not belong to the great Lord Prince of the tribe, Sevik. Spacious and comfortable, Sevik's tent could be better described as a complex of clothed tents mounted together. It is a great place to rest and relax, with divisions split by hanging cloth, giving it a more homely feeling. It is obviously not devoid of furniture, from some cabinets, paintings, art sculptures and only enough light to allow you to see both what is in front of you and a lizardman's bioluminescent scales. If you head [bold type]west[roman type] of here, you will arrive at the temple, and [bold type]southwest[roman type] would get you back to the center of the encampment.";

instead of smelling Sevik's Tent:
	say "     Incenses are the most common smell, though sometimes it smells of a warm scented bath instead, due to the water vapor with the flowery essences in the air.";

to say SevikTalkHimself:
	say "     You tell him that you would like to know more about Sevik himself, how he came to be a prince, and even before that, his life as a human. He shows a genuine smile hearing your question and seems happy to respond. 'Well, as you already know, I and Uzial were a couple. We dreamed of all those things couples dream about, like buying a house, having a family, kids and all that, but as you can see... Things really didn't go as planned.' You express your sympathies, but argue that is never too late to adopt a few children of their own, if they so wished. 'Well, that's sort of what we did with this tribe, though that's... another question. What I meant was biological children. I'm... not sure if that passes, but I used to be a female.'";
	say "     No, you cannot really say you could tell that at first glance, but you do end up asking if he - or she - feels okay in this new body. 'Interestingly enough, yes, I do. I think I much prefer this, to be honest, which is... Something that hadn't crossed my mind ever... And Uzial seems to like it too. We've been looking for a way to bear children in our current bodies, but so far it has been a little difficult... We don't fully understand how these transformations work. But we'll find a way, I'm sure. Do feel free to address me as a male, dear, for I do not pity my fate. Much the contrary.'";

to say SevikTalkCamp:
	say "     About the camp, you ask how this entire thing came to be, as this is something rather unique. 'This whole tribe existed far before we even got here. I can't even explain how they appeared, but all these lizardmen immediately sounded like they came from a very distant past... We became their leaders only because of an fortunate accident with Uzial, which I'm sure you can tell...' He means the giantism, you bet, and that is what you tell him. 'Indeed. Well, you know, with the lizardmen roaming about it was fairly easy to get one's attention and we weren't exactly an innocent couple. We had sex with some, and the transformation took its place. Uzial was also into men, which was another exciting factor. In any case, after that, we were brought to their tribe, which was a normal tribe at the time...'";
	say "     'This accident I speak of happened when Uzial came in contact with a strange totem deep inside the temple, because he was one curious fellow and wanted to explore deep inside where the lizardmen told us not to go, as it was dangerous. Bravely, he discovered this totem and touched it. Found himself with magical powers and a grand new size that crumbled most of the underground passages. Now a giant wizard of some sort, the tribe proclaimed him a god, and he took that to heart. I'm the only person he allows to treat him in an informal manner and decided that I shall be the Lord Prince. As for the underground caves... They're sealed, for now.'";
	WaitLineBreak;
	say "     'So, pretty much since then, he has made this tribe prosper and erected a barrier to protect them from outsiders. Our relationship is still going, but we've decided to keep it officially open, as circumstances differ... But I don't mind it.'";

Purely appearance-wise, he is also fairly different than most, as he is covered in bioluminescent scales of various colors, complemented by the extravagant and oversized jewelry with the huge gemstones and bright gold. His body is bound with muscle, sculpted like you would truly expect from a god, and his beauty is unmeasurable, mesmerizing and almost hypnotic with the glowing scales in the only dimly illuminated room. He wears no loincloth covering his crotch, so you have a clear view to his slit as he sits on his throne with his long and strong legs spread to the sides.";
