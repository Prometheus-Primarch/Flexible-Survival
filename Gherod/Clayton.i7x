to say CherryTalkClayton:
	say "     Seeing how Cherry seems to be deep in thought, you resolve asking her if everything is fine. She takes a moment to process your words as she pulls herself from the tumultuous daydreaming sea in her head, turning to face you with a slightly surprised expression. 'Oh, it is nothing, my dear. I'm simply... Well, worrying about a few acquaintances of mine, nothing more.' You figure you should ask her a bit more about it, as you may be able to assist her with any trouble. The pink fox smiles at your gesture, happy to see that you cared about her personal issues. 'My apologies. I tend to act all high and mighty, it became a habit due to my job and other struggles in life, but it simply does not make me immune to worry. I am not the cold woman the world wanted me to be, for the better or worse...'";
	say "     She then recollects herself from this brief distraction and seems keen on telling you what is going on. 'Alright, darling, there is indeed someone that worries me a little, an old friend of mine who used to own a farm in the outskirts of the district, and I would appreciate a moment of your time so I could send you on an errand to assist him. But, of course, it can wait if you have any pending matters. I don't mean to impose.'";
	LineBreak;
	say "     Cherry seems to want to ask you a favor, and that means [bold type]you will likely be busy[roman type] for at least the next hours. Knowing this, [bold type]should you accept it[roman type]? You can always return later and speak to her again.";
	say "     ([link]Y[as]y[end link]) - Assist Cherry.";
	say "     ([link]N[as]n[end link]) - Not right now.";
	if Player consents: [unlocks Clayton]
		LineBreak;
		now CherryDoneTalking is true;
		say "     You let Cherry know that you can very well assist her, since there is enough free time that allows you to do so. She, once more, shows a genuine smile as you declare yourself available and willing to help. 'That's wonderful news! And I must add, he may be someone you would like to get to know, depending on your tastes... But he can also be quite accommodating. Anyway, enough blabbering, I shall head straight to the point.' The pink fox readjusts herself in her couch as she places down the cup of tea she was taking sips from on her lap.";
		say "     'This friend of mine used to be a wonderful man that I grew quite attached to, a confident of mine, if you'd like to call him that. And, well, he still is a wonderful man, except... He has sustained a quite odd mutation.' Cherry takes a deep breath as she gathers her words. 'You see, he owned a farm, and when this entire mess began, his animals went completely and utterly crazy. Obviously, nobody expects their caring herd to suddenly find them suitable as a love mate and start chasing them around to do the deed, and much less to have been mutated into bipedal creatures with more than enough skill to subdue them, if they so wished. Now, you may wonder... This is quite an anomaly, is it not? Because it is.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Clayton, who is my friend's name, was part of a test program created by Zephyr related to gene-altering nanites. I don't know the specifics, and am unsure if they are the same types of nanites we have to deal with nowadays, but his herd was the target of said tests, especially cows. They were supposed to increase their productivity and quality of their milk, as well as longevity and health, albeit they still had unverified secondary effects. This is highly classified information that I am trusting you with, but as you should know, they had to find ways to test their technology. Anyway... It seems that once the apocalypse arrived, his herd began to undergo several physical changes that turned them into horny anthropomorphic messes. Clayton got assaulted by several of them just as I arrived.'";
		say "     'Having had my own problematic encounter not long ago, I too have earned myself several charms, and they were at my disposal, so I managed to distract his herd and led them astray long enough to allow Clayton to make his escape. With his farm now becoming an unsafe location, I met with him later on and offered my other property for him to stay. As for Clayton himself, however...' She gets up, placing her cup on the coffee table and walking around the couch. 'He was turned into quite the massive bull. Like, unnaturally large. I've never seen anything like that... And obviously, that would hinder any of his attempts at scavenging unnoticed. Surely he would be able to defend himself, but I also worry that he could become... a threat to wanderers, as his mind got inevitably affected with hypersexual tendencies, much like it tends to happen to the average nanite-infected.'";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'However, Clayton is still himself, deep down. He has not succumbed to feral depravity and has shown himself to be quite a remarkable and strong-willed individual, much to my joy. Yet, I fear isolation will not do him good, so I wanted to ask you to come visit him and help me carry a box of supplies I've arranged for him. Perhaps you could even... befriend him.' Cherry heads over her pantry to go fetch this large box, which also seems quite heavy. 'Naturally, if I were to carry all of this on my own, it'd make me an easy target for creatures and all manners of villains out there, but I'm positive that if we travel together, we could more safely make it.'";
		say "     Cherry then walks over to the door as she resumes speaking to you, 'Well, I hope I've informed you on the subject well enough. If you are still willing to assist me, we could be on our way there right now.' Seeing no reason to stall this any further, you nod, readying yourself to travel with Cherry to your target location. 'Splendid. I shall take the lead and guide us through the safest routes, hopefully. And I'm quite sure you'll like to meet Clayton.' Without any further ado, Cherry proceeds to request that you open the door for her, and you do so before following right after her, and after you have made sure you closed it properly.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		clear the screen;
		say "     Safely heading out of the apartment complex, you and Cherry make it to the streets while, hopefully, remaining out of sight from undesired roamers. Also, as the supply box is considerably heavy, you take turns with your pink fox friend, which alleviates your efforts. Fortunately, it does seem like a calm day, so you have little trouble finding discrete enough routes and make steady progress towards your destination. On the way, Cherry explains you how which shortcuts to take in order to make your path safer and quicker, and you easily get a good idea of how to navigate this district and reach her second property. 'It is not too far, but having to cross the entirety of the district towards the outskirts is somewhat of an inconvenience...'";
		say "     Eventually, you safely arrive at your destination. 'Here we are. It is simply a modest house in a quiet neighborhood, a place I mostly went to during the weekends and such. It's a peaceful spot to rest, has a large backyard and an annex, perfect to indulge in outside hobbies. I thought Clayton would fit in well enough, and I hope I wasn't wrong...' she stops before taking a deep breath and turning her face towards yours, 'I haven't seen him in several days, as I've been busy tending to myself... Anyway, we'll see how he's faring.' Indeed, Cherry's second house could be described as modest for someone of her ranking in a corporation, but it is, in fact, very sizable. It features a tall enough surrounding wall for privacy and, as you are able to see once Cherry opens the gate with her spare keys, you see just how big its exterior is. You doubt anyone would not feel comfortable living here.";

		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Without any further ado, you make it to the entrance door. Here, the pink fox hands you over the supply box before knocking, a polite gesture she opts for instead of opening the door right away. 'Hello? Clayton dear, it's me, Cherry!' she says, leaning over the door's wooden surface as she checks for any noise from inside. Several seconds pass and she gets no reply, so she knocks once more, repeating herself with the same words. A few moments later, she still gets no response. 'Well, he could be in the annex. Unfortunately the bell is in no working condition, so we'll have to try checking back there. Through here,' she tells you, beckoning you to follow right after her as you make it towards the backyard, across a narrower pathway of stone.";
		say "     'I see Clayton has been tending to the garden. The plants are looking healthy... This is a good sign,' Cherry comments as you arrive at the backyard. The bull does not seem to be here, but one of the doors to the annex building was left ajar. She beckons you to follow her towards that same door, and slowly, she pushes it open while peeking inside. 'Chauncy? Are you in here?' she asks, and finally, a deep male voice booms from deeper inside, 'Huh... Oh! Cherry! Is that ye? Hol' on, aye, I... uh, I'm... I'll be right there!' The pink fox smiles as she hears her friend, and tells you to place the box on top of a nearby table. 'You wouldn't want to keep holding on to that, right?' You simply do as she says, bringing longing relief to your arms.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     Eventually, you hear (and feel) heavy footsteps growing nearer, and this massive, towering bull appears before you and the fox. He appears to have attained an exceptionally bulky and incredibly muscular frame, unnaturally so, and his height reaches nearly an impressive nine feet. There is also a pair of large tauric horns atop his bovine head that curve forward, like an actual bull's, and he gave himself a nose ring. Taking a more attentive look at his body, it is completely covered in a light brown, almost golden, short-length fur, which lightens up on the front. His muscles are truly enormous, especially his chest, with each pectoral bulging forward as thick masses of muscle, ending in eye-catching puffy nipples. Resuming at the hips and downwards, he has strong two-jointed legs that end in hooves, while between them dangles a long and monstrously thick human-like cock with a pair of two massive and full balls hanging underneath. Obviously, someone as huge as him would struggle to find proper pieces of clothing to cover himself with, but in his own home, he does not seem to care about concealing any part of his body at all, walking around completely naked even in your presence.";
		say "     Now you know why Clayton had the need of a big enough house. Even now he has to curve himself down slightly so to not bump his horns into the ceiling.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     'Cherry! It's been a while! How've you been?!' he says to the pink fox, coming for a hug that, for moments, you fear it could crush the poor lady, but he is surprisingly gentle about it, even as her entire upper frame sort of disappears amidst the bull's embrace. 'Well, I'm glad you've been doing alright! Hopefully we didn't interrupt anything?' she asks, and as the bull carefully pulls away, he scratches his head, as if thinking. 'Uh... Nay, y'didn't. Eh, I mean, uh... Nothin['] important. Was just tryin'a get somethin['] workin['] but these big hands ain't good for precise jobs. But nothin['] y'should worry [']bout, aye. To what do I owe the pleasure, if ye don't mind me askin[']?'";
		say "     'Oh, I've just come to deliver you a box of supplies I'm sure you would find useful, and... I also came to introduce a friend of mine,' she then beckons you to approach them, and as you step forward, Clayton's eyes wander through your figure from head to feet and back up, as a smirky grin forms across his muzzle. 'Ye're in good company...! Is this som['] wanderer ye've caught in the wil[']?' he asks, and now that you are standing close to the bull, you notice his strong animalistic musk as it fills your nostrils. Almost immediately, you feel significantly aroused, as this scent feels heavily loaded with pheromones that, no matter what you are usually into, manage to trigger your lusts just right. The fact he is standing completely naked strengthens its effectiveness, you feel.";
		WaitLineBreak;
		say "     '[SubjectProCap] found me, in fact, while I was in a bit of a pickle. Fortunately, everything went well, and I ended up inviting [ObjectPro] home for some tea,' she explains, though Clayton seems very enthralled by you, for some reason. You have an idea in what way exactly once you catch his enormous meat giving a little twitch. 'Good lookin' [guygal], if I'm to say. I wouldn't mind gettin['] t'know [ObjectPro] myself, always down t'make friends!'. Cherry seems happy to hear this as she replies right after, 'Oh, that is wonderful to hear, my dear! It was with that intention in mind that I've decided to introduce [ObjectPro] to you. I thought you could get along and not feel so lonely all the time. I'm glad to know that I was right.'";

		say "     'Anyway, since you two are getting along, I shall be on my way. We've left your supplies atop that table over there, so feel free to make use of them.' Cherry then gently strokes one of Clayton's hands, before patting your shoulder as well, and begins to head towards the door. 'Aw, ye're leavin['] already? Thought we could have a meal together or somethin[']...' the bull stops her, but the pink fox seems adamant on taking her leave. 'Much appreciated, Clayton, and I shall take on that offer some other day, but I thought it'd be better to let you know each other better in a more... private setting,' she replies, chuckling and winking in your direction. 'Enjoy yourselves!'";
		say "     After the pink fox leaves you alone with the bull, he looks over the box, then back to you. 'Well, then I guess [']tis as good a time as any for introductions, aye? Name's Clayton, used t'be a local farmer before shite hit the fans. If ye're a friend of Cherry's then ye're my friend as well.' He walks up to you and pats your shoulder with a much heavier hand than you could anticipate, then with a gentle squeeze, he pulls away before beckoning you towards the supply box. 'Now, let's see what ol' Cherry brought. She's a really sweet lass for rememberin[']. And y'helped bringin['] this stuff, too?' You nod as he checks the box's contents, and it seems it is mostly food in great condition, most in cans for better preservation, and several bottles of clean water.";

Taking note of Clayton's words, you place your hands only on the upper part of his pecs and decide to give them a broad rubbing.

'Aye, ye're givin['] me a good rub... Feels really good...' Hearing Clayton's praise, you feel more confident to grab them and squeeze, then move your hands some more around those marvelously sized pecs, which is just making the bull moan. 'O-ooh, fuck...
