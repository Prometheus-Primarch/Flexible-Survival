They've got backpacks and gear, complete with melee weapons, and apparently are preparing for an expedition out into the city. Brave plans, as they're not looking like the most hard-boiled fighters. But then, maybe they don't need to be, if they're stealthy. You stop and give them some tips from your own forays in the city, then return to the [location of Player].";

Given that there are... eight, no nine, different species of kids among her flock, this is far from an easy task.
